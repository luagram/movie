I would keep my distance for now.

he's not just gonna let that go.

Did you consider
the physical pain he'll put Bella through?

help with the thirst.

Are you okay?

Never better.

This was necessary.

What does that mean?

25:42.184 --> 25:43.624
I really think it would be better...

25:43.719 --> 25:45.379
I wanna know what happened to you.

25:45.588 --> 25:46.708
I can't tell you.

25:48.190 --> 25:49.660
I think I deserve an explanation.

25:49.792 --> 25:50.792
You do.

25:52.962 --> 25:54.932
But if you really need
one, I can't stay here.

that for whatever reason,

tell you anything that you need to know?

26:32.835 --> 26:34.425
And I don't need to know this?

26:35.438 --> 26:36.438
No.

I missed you, Bells.

I'm not sure she is a newborn.

29:55.804 --> 29:57.774
But I never felt more alive.

29:59.909 --> 30:01.539
I was born to be a vampire.

30:17.226 --> 30:18.816
Everything was falling into place.

Even the Volturi
seemed to accept my new status.

how long we would have with her.

Senna and Zafrina.

44:03.885 --> 44:05.105
From the Amazon.

44:15.196 --> 44:17.716
BELLA: The arrival of Senna and Zafrina
meant that our plea was being heard

44:17.832 --> 44:19.962
in even the most remote
corners of the world

44:20.435 --> 44:22.435
while others searched for
witnesses closer to home.

44:22.570 --> 44:23.830
(SINGING)

44:28.009 --> 44:30.909
BELLA: A patriot Carlisle first met
on the battlefield at Yorktown

44:31.045 --> 44:33.065
would become our most unlikely ally.

44:33.681 --> 44:35.381
(GRUNTING)

44:35.617 --> 44:37.737
Shut up!

44:40.188 --> 44:42.848
I hated the first British invasion.

44:43.525 --> 44:45.755
And I hate the second one even more.

44:46.294 --> 44:47.424
EMMETT: Even the Beatles?

44:48.496 --> 44:49.516
Really, Garrett?

44:51.099 --> 44:52.729
Old habits die hard.

44:53.168 --> 44:55.258
- Carlisle needs you.
- (GROANS)

44:56.137 --> 44:57.697
(PANTING)

44:57.806 --> 44:59.026
Sounds interesting.

45:00.241 --> 45:01.271
MAN: Help!

45:01.409 --> 45:03.309
But first I'd better finish my meal.

45:16.457 --> 45:17.817
Each was made to see.

45:24.666 --> 45:27.966
Carlisle convinced his Irish friends
to make the journey to Forks.

45:29.804 --> 45:31.804
Although we were grateful for their help,

45:31.940 --> 45:34.670
their thirst for human blood
complicated the situation.

45:40.281 --> 45:43.651
The nomads Rosalie and Emmett sent
were even more unpredictable.

45:45.353 --> 45:46.583
Especially Peter

45:46.688 --> 45:48.988
who had fought alongside
Jasper as a newborn.

45:50.992 --> 45:52.792
Lotta red eyes around here.

45:52.894 --> 45:54.794
They agreed not to hunt in the area.

45:57.665 --> 45:59.255
But they'll feed somewhere.

46:01.970 --> 46:04.530
BELLA: As more vampires
set foot in their territory,

46:04.639 --> 46:05.659
more Quileutes turned.

46:06.040 --> 46:08.170
Their nature compelling
them to join the pack.

46:08.309 --> 46:10.869
(GROWLING)

46:11.212 --> 46:13.442
Hey, easy there. Hey!

- It's all right.

You're gonna be okay.

46:16.985 --> 46:18.775
(WHINING)

BELLA: Finally, Carlisle and Esme
returned with our last witness.

46:26.394 --> 46:28.494
- How many came?
- EDWARD: Eighteen.

46:28.897 --> 46:30.227
You have some good friends.

46:30.665 --> 46:31.665
And Alice?

46:34.869 --> 46:36.629
We'll all be on Aro's list now.

46:37.005 --> 46:39.195
Centuries on the run.
That's what you've brought me.

46:39.841 --> 46:41.311
Some friend, Carlisle.

46:42.110 --> 46:43.410
Alistair, come meet everyone.

46:43.845 --> 46:47.005
I already told you, if it comes to a fight,
I won't stand against the Volturi.

46:47.115 --> 46:48.505
It won't come to a fight.

46:50.251 --> 46:51.841
I'll be in the attic.

47:00.528 --> 47:01.888
He's not a people person.

47:03.731 --> 47:06.201
BELLA: We opened our home to 18 vampires.

47:06.868 --> 47:08.228
Many with gifts of their own.

47:11.372 --> 47:13.272
Zafrina had power over the mind.

47:14.142 --> 47:16.512
She could make anyone see
what she wanted them to.

47:42.103 --> 47:44.863
If she weren't holding my hand right now,
I could swear this was real.

47:45.974 --> 47:47.204
I don't see anything.

47:50.311 --> 47:52.591
ELEAZAR: Edward,
you didn't tell me your wife is a shield.

47:56.250 --> 47:57.550
What's a shield?

47:58.486 --> 48:00.246
The ones I've met are so different.

48:00.989 --> 48:02.319
It's a defensive talent.

48:03.424 --> 48:05.304
It's why I couldn't read your mind,
even before.

48:05.593 --> 48:06.823
It's why Aro couldn't.

48:06.961 --> 48:08.621
You have a very powerful gift.

48:08.730 --> 48:09.890
(CRACKLING)

48:09.998 --> 48:11.728
Oh, yeah, she's a shield, all right.

48:12.333 --> 48:13.663
Shoulda put her on her ass.

48:13.935 --> 48:15.955
Or your voltage has been exaggerated.

48:16.938 --> 48:18.338
Maybe it only works on the weak.

48:22.477 --> 48:24.237
Garrett, I wouldn't.

48:25.179 --> 48:26.939

can do some serious damage.

48:39.027 --> 48:41.357
Which is why you'll need
to control your phasing.

48:42.563 --> 48:46.333
If your mom pisses you off,
you don't want to tear her head off.

48:56.244 --> 48:58.114
Whoever's coming wasn't invited.

CARLISLE: Vladimir, Stefan,

49:53.501 --> 49:54.931
you're a long way from home.

49:55.403 --> 49:56.963
What are they doing here?

49:57.105 --> 49:59.535
We heard the Volturi
were moving against you.

49:59.807 --> 50:01.367
But that you would not stand alone.

50:01.976 --> 50:03.526
We didn't do what we were accused of.

50:03.644 --> 50:06.444
We do not care what you did, Carlisle.

50:06.614 --> 50:08.744
We have been waiting a millennium

50:09.183 --> 50:12.743
for the ltalian scum to be challenged.

50:13.354 --> 50:15.484
It's not our plan to fight the Volturi.

50:15.623 --> 50:16.893
Shame.

50:17.492 --> 50:20.092
Aro's witnesses will be so disappointed.

50:20.328 --> 50:22.758
They enjoy a good fight. (CHUCKLES)

50:24.966 --> 50:26.226
Aro's witnesses?

50:26.334 --> 50:27.334
VLADIMIR: Aww.

50:27.668 --> 50:29.468
Still hoping they'll listen?

50:31.539 --> 50:33.969
ELEAZAR: When Aro
wants someone from a coven

50:34.108 --> 50:38.098
it's never long before evidence turns up
proving that coven committed some crime.

50:38.212 --> 50:39.582
So he's done this before?

50:39.847 --> 50:42.977
It happens so rarely,
I never realized it was a pattern.

50:43.151 --> 50:46.851
Apparently he always pardons one person
whose thoughts he claims are repentant.

50:47.121 --> 50:49.091
This person always has an ability.

50:49.557 --> 50:51.677
And they're always given
a place with the Guard.

50:51.859 --> 50:53.259
This is all about Alice.

50:53.895 --> 50:56.325
- He has no one like her.
- Which is why she left.

50:56.497 --> 50:57.827
Why does he need witnesses?

50:57.999 --> 51:00.489
To spread the word
that justice has been served.

51:01.235 --> 51:03.355
After he slaughters an entire coven.

51:07.408 --> 51:09.038
AMUN: Benjamin, Tia,

51:09.177 --> 51:11.197
- we're leaving.
- And where will you go?

51:11.746 --> 51:13.866
What makes you think
they'll be satisfied with Alice?

51:14.682 --> 51:16.812
What's to stop them
from going after Benjamin next?

51:16.984 --> 51:18.044
Or Zafrina or Kate

51:18.219 --> 51:19.979
or anyone else with a gift?
Anyone they want.

51:20.321 --> 51:21.921
Their goal isn't punishment, it's power.

51:22.023 --> 51:23.293
It's acquisition.

51:23.691 --> 51:25.781
Carlisle might not ask you
to fight, but I will.

51:26.327 --> 51:29.127
For the sake of my family.
But also for yours.

51:30.231 --> 51:31.821

I fought a king's rule.

51:52.153 --> 51:53.423
We'll join you.

No.

51:55.957 --> 51:57.747
I will do the right thing, Amun.

1:01:17.084 --> 1:01:18.084
But come on,

1:01:18.418 --> 1:01:20.478
Dracula One and Two are

1:01:23.924 --> 1:01:25.524
- creepy.
- (BOTH LAUGHING)

1:01:38.906 --> 1:01:40.456
CHARLIE: There she is. Come here.

1:01:40.774 --> 1:01:41.934
Oh!

1:01:42.409 --> 1:01:44.499
Wow! Look at you.

1:01:44.878 --> 1:01:46.038
You've grown half a foot!

1:01:46.880 --> 1:01:47.880
Seriously.

1:01:48.582 --> 1:01:49.742
Like 6 inches.

1:01:51.118 --> 1:01:52.808
Come on inside. Lunch is on the table.

1:01:52.920 --> 1:01:54.250
We got a tree to decorate, huh?

1:01:54.521 --> 1:01:57.251
I've actually got a few
errands to run, guys.

1:01:57.357 --> 1:01:58.647
I'll be back soon, okay?

1:02:00.861 --> 1:02:02.781
- CHARLIE: Come on. Let's go.
- (RENESMEE LAUGHS)

1:02:03.964 --> 1:02:04.964
(ENGINE STARTS)

1:02:10.504 --> 1:02:12.564
BELLA: Alice's note
gave me a new sense of hope.

1:02:13.574 --> 1:02:15.574
Maybe she had a plan for us after all.

1:02:16.777 --> 1:02:22.627
And maybe J. Jenks was the key.

1:02:41.635 --> 1:02:43.865
BELLA: I'm meeting Mr. Jenks.
HOST: Right this way.

1:02:47.107 --> 1:02:49.077
- JENKS: Mrs. Cullen.
- Hi.

1:02:49.543 --> 1:02:51.013
I'm so happy you called.

1:03:04.558 --> 1:03:07.048
I always meet my private clients here.

1:03:07.160 --> 1:03:09.190
It's more comfortable than the office.

1:03:09.930 --> 1:03:11.330
And it's more public.

1:03:12.199 --> 1:03:13.559
Ah. (CHUCKLES)

1:03:13.700 --> 1:03:15.360
What type of work do you do, J.?

1:03:15.736 --> 1:03:17.256
Oh, you know, this and that.

1:03:18.138 --> 1:03:20.768
It's always different,
which keeps it interesting.

1:03:23.076 --> 1:03:24.696
Have you known Alice and Jasper long?

1:03:25.979 --> 1:03:29.249
I've been working with them
for more than 20 years.

1:03:29.417 --> 1:03:33.247
And my late partner
knew Jasper 15 years before that.

1:03:33.388 --> 1:03:34.548
He is, uh,

1:03:36.224 --> 1:03:38.254
unusually well-preserved.

1:03:40.295 --> 1:03:41.625
Yes, he is.

1:03:45.133 --> 1:03:48.863
I trust that Mr. Jasper
is enjoying his vacation.

1:03:50.405 --> 1:03:52.565
He didn't tell you where
he was going, did he?

1:03:52.740 --> 1:03:55.770
No, no, no,
he just mentioned that he was leaving

1:03:55.910 --> 1:03:57.900
when he came by to place his order.

1:04:00.081 --> 1:04:01.951
I assume that his order is ready?

1:04:02.116 --> 1:04:03.276
Of course.

1:04:04.118 --> 1:04:06.088
I've never been late with a delivery.

1:04:25.239 --> 1:04:26.759
There a problem?

1:04:29.277 --> 1:04:30.277
No.

1:04:33.247 --> 1:04:35.647
My husband and I thought
that we'd all be traveling together.

1:04:35.650 --> 1:04:37.450
Jasper said only two were traveling.

1:04:37.685 --> 1:04:39.145
His instructions were very clear.

1:04:39.454 --> 1:04:40.614
It's my mistake.

1:04:43.591 --> 1:04:45.421
Apparently, that's not going to happen.

1:05:06.815 --> 1:05:08.775
BELLA: Alice's vision was clear.

1:05:12.721 --> 1:05:14.621
Renesmee would have a future.

1:05:16.558 --> 1:05:18.458
But Edward and I wouldn't be a part of it.

1:05:25.000 --> 1:05:26.300
How ya doin'?

1:05:31.507 --> 1:05:32.797
(INAUDIBLE)

1:05:46.021 --> 1:05:47.421
BELLA: "My dearest Renesmee",

1:05:48.190 --> 1:05:50.060
"I thought we would have forever together."

1:05:51.060 --> 1:05:53.030
"But forever isn't as long as I'd hoped."

1:05:54.029 --> 1:05:56.049
"I know now why Alice left me clues."

1:05:56.732 --> 1:05:57.992
"It was to keep you safe."

1:05:59.601 --> 1:06:02.001
"Everything you and Jacob will need
is in this pack."

1:06:04.073 --> 1:06:05.343
"Jacob will protect you."

1:06:06.108 --> 1:06:08.188
"And he'll help you learn
about the Ticuna legends."

1:06:12.114 --> 1:06:13.674
It's a romantic notion, isn't it?

1:06:14.483 --> 1:06:17.353
That a righteous few can defy a great evil.

1:06:18.587 --> 1:06:22.177
I must admit, you even had me believing.

1:06:22.958 --> 1:06:24.048
For a moment.

1:06:25.394 --> 1:06:26.394
(CHUCKLES)

1:06:26.929 --> 1:06:29.299
Well, good luck. You're gonna need it.

1:06:34.002 --> 1:06:35.002
Cheers.

1:06:44.981 --> 1:06:46.241
The snow is sticking.

1:06:47.183 --> 1:06:48.313
Hey, we still have today.

1:06:55.959 --> 1:06:58.259
I'm so glad Charlie found somebody
to take care of him.

1:06:59.095 --> 1:07:00.485
Bella, no one's giving up here.

1:07:03.099 --> 1:07:05.089
All right! Present time! Let's go!

1:07:05.802 --> 1:07:07.132
Seth, Leah, stop eating.

1:07:09.005 --> 1:07:10.435
Jake, you start. Get it going.

1:07:11.341 --> 1:07:13.741
SETH: What did you get me?
LEAH: I'm not giving you anything.

1:07:14.511 --> 1:07:15.641
SETH: Hey! No, come on,
what did you get me?

1:07:15.778 --> 1:07:17.208
BELLA: Well, Dad,
we didn't have time to wrap yours,

1:07:17.313 --> 1:07:18.443
but here it is.

1:07:24.187 --> 1:07:26.547
It's a 5-day fishing trip to Fraser River.

1:07:26.890 --> 1:07:27.980
It's for you and Sue.

1:07:28.525 --> 1:07:29.785
You leave tomorrow.

1:07:30.160 --> 1:07:32.560
Wow, that's really nice. Thank you.

1:07:33.530 --> 1:07:34.850
Tomorrow? I can't leave tomorrow.

1:07:35.098 --> 1:07:36.788
I made arrangements for you at work.

1:07:38.334 --> 1:07:39.394
Sneaky.

1:07:41.070 --> 1:07:42.540
And extravagant.

1:07:43.439 --> 1:07:45.129
And non-refundable, I'm afraid.

1:07:47.076 --> 1:07:48.476
You two trying to get rid of me?

1:07:51.114 --> 1:07:53.174
Because it's working! (CHUCKLES)

1:07:54.450 --> 1:07:56.710
Fraser River.
That means we'll be chasing Cutthroat.

1:07:57.520 --> 1:07:59.400
SUE: We might even hook
a Rainbow or some Bulls.

1:08:00.757 --> 1:08:01.917
Woman knows her trout.

1:08:03.459 --> 1:08:05.189
Hey, beautiful. Let me see.

1:08:07.197 --> 1:08:08.427
Jacob make this for you?

1:08:09.432 --> 1:08:10.432
Wanna put it on?

1:08:15.573 --> 1:08:16.733
It's so pretty.

1:08:17.408 --> 1:08:18.708
It is really pretty.

1:08:39.763 --> 1:08:41.363
That's what I'm talkin' about.

1:08:43.634 --> 1:08:45.434
A little pre-battle bonfire.

1:08:47.972 --> 1:08:49.802
Telling war stories.

1:08:53.244 --> 1:08:55.474
Or just standing there
like frickin' statues.

1:08:58.082 --> 1:09:00.982
Name any American battle. I was there.

1:09:03.754 --> 1:09:04.884
Little Bighorn.

1:09:06.690 --> 1:09:09.160
I came this close to biting Custer.

1:09:09.293 --> 1:09:11.063
But the lndians got him first.

1:09:12.796 --> 1:09:15.256
Try Oleg's assault on Constantinople.

1:09:16.000 --> 1:09:17.800
He didn't win that one on his own.

1:09:17.935 --> 1:09:19.215
LIAM: If you're talking battles,

1:09:19.303 --> 1:09:20.783
you're talking the Eleven Years' War.

1:09:20.971 --> 1:09:23.461
No one does rebellion like the lrish.

1:09:23.641 --> 1:09:25.341
You lost the Eleven Years' War.

1:09:25.476 --> 1:09:28.136
Aye. But it was one hell of a rebellion.

1:09:29.313 --> 1:09:31.713
VLADIMIR: When we ruled,
everything came to us.

1:09:32.149 --> 1:09:33.169
Prey,

1:09:33.417 --> 1:09:34.437
diplomats,

1:09:35.019 --> 1:09:36.109
favor seekers.

1:09:37.054 --> 1:09:38.724
Such was our power.

1:09:39.423 --> 1:09:42.983
But we never put on white hats
and called ourselves saints.

1:09:43.160 --> 1:09:46.720
We were honest about what we were.

1:09:47.031 --> 1:09:50.061
VLADIMIR: We sat still
for a very long time.

1:09:51.336 --> 1:09:54.066
We didn't notice we were
beginning to petrify.

1:09:56.274 --> 1:09:59.374
Perhaps the Volturi did
us a favor when they

1:10:00.278 --> 1:10:02.038
burned our castles.

1:10:02.180 --> 1:10:05.310
We've been waiting 1,500 years

1:10:06.084 --> 1:10:07.574
to return that favor.

1:10:10.088 --> 1:10:13.318
We have been ready to do battle for ages.

1:10:15.193 --> 1:10:16.723
EDWARD: I can't help thinking,

1:10:16.895 --> 1:10:18.385
all these people
are putting themselves in danger

1:10:18.530 --> 1:10:20.090
because I fell in love with a human.

1:10:20.231 --> 1:10:21.561
CARLISLE: You found your mate.

1:10:21.733 --> 1:10:23.063
You deserve to be happy.

1:10:24.269 --> 1:10:25.699
But at what cost?

1:10:25.804 --> 1:10:27.534
Everyone here has something to fight for.

1:10:27.906 --> 1:10:29.026
I certainly do.

1:10:40.885 --> 1:10:42.275
Carlisle, I've never thanked you.

1:10:45.423 --> 1:10:47.083
For this extraordinary life.

1:11:05.577 --> 1:11:07.407
This means "More than my own life."

1:11:07.512 --> 1:11:08.882
That's how much I love you.

1:11:10.448 --> 1:11:12.538
Tomorrow I'm gonna need you
to stay with Jacob.

1:11:14.419 --> 1:11:15.649
No matter what.

1:11:16.988 --> 1:11:18.548
Even if I tell him that...

1:11:20.792 --> 1:11:22.322
That he has to take you somewhere.

1:11:25.264 --> 1:11:26.564
Hey.

1:11:26.665 --> 1:11:27.785
Baby, it's all right.

1:11:29.335 --> 1:11:30.725
You're gonna be safe.

1:11:34.540 --> 1:11:35.630
Always.

1:12:21.353 --> 1:12:23.013
If we live through this,

1:12:24.190 --> 1:12:26.320
I'll follow you anywhere, woman.

1:12:29.895 --> 1:12:31.185
Now you tell me.

1:12:46.979 --> 1:12:49.909
The Redcoats are coming!
The Redcoats are coming!

1:13:27.320 --> 1:13:28.720

CARLISLE: Aro,

1:14:27.681 --> 1:14:29.811
let us discuss things as we used to.

1:14:29.983 --> 1:14:31.283
In a civilized manner.

1:14:31.685 --> 1:14:33.415
Fair words, Carlisle.

1:14:34.555 --> 1:14:35.915
But a little out of place,

1:14:36.023 --> 1:14:38.863
given the battalion
you've assembled against us.

1:14:39.360 --> 1:14:41.950
I can promise you, that
was never my intent.

1:14:42.630 --> 1:14:44.330
No laws have been broken.

1:14:44.832 --> 1:14:45.962
We see the child.

1:14:46.500 --> 1:14:48.730
Do not treat us as fools.

1:14:48.869 --> 1:14:50.839
She is not an immortal!

1:14:53.441 --> 1:14:55.311
These witnesses can attest to that.

1:14:56.844 --> 1:14:58.184
Or you can look.

1:14:59.380 --> 1:15:01.470
See the flush of human blood in her cheeks.

1:15:01.616 --> 1:15:02.616
Artifice!

1:15:02.984 --> 1:15:06.354
I will collect every facet of the truth.

1:15:07.388 --> 1:15:10.588
But from someone more central to the story.

1:15:11.525 --> 1:15:12.615
Edward,

1:15:13.661 --> 1:15:17.121
as the child clings to your newborn mate,

1:15:18.699 --> 1:15:21.789
I assume you are involved.

1:16:35.477 --> 1:16:37.167
I'd like to meet her.

1:16:49.925 --> 1:16:51.385
(GROWLS)

1:17:30.432 --> 1:17:31.902

1:18:10.706 --> 1:18:11.826

half immortal.

1:18:48.311 --> 1:18:50.541
while she was still human.

1:18:50.980 --> 1:18:52.110
Impossible!

1:18:54.050 --> 1:18:56.380

1:19:28.318 --> 1:19:29.338
I'm not sure.

1:19:29.486 --> 1:19:30.816
Jane.

1:19:30.954 --> 1:19:33.794
She's changed. This child is bigger.

1:19:34.291 --> 1:19:36.121
Then your allegations were false.

1:19:36.727 --> 1:19:38.017
The Cullens are innocent.

1:19:38.695 --> 1:19:41.315
I take full responsibility for my mistake.

I'm sorry.

1:22:04.809 --> 1:22:06.799
that there is no danger?

1:22:10.915 --> 1:22:13.645
For the first time in our history

1:22:15.653 --> 1:22:18.453
humans pose a threat

1:22:19.023 --> 1:22:20.513
to our kind.

1:22:21.025 --> 1:22:23.485
Their modern technology

1:22:23.661 --> 1:22:27.291
has given birth to weapons
that could destroy us.

1:22:29.768 --> 1:22:32.168
Maintaining our secret

1:22:32.504 --> 1:22:34.974
has never been more imperative.

1:22:37.409 --> 1:22:40.209
In such perilous times,

1:22:41.680 --> 1:22:43.480
only the known

1:22:44.316 --> 1:22:45.536
is safe.

1:22:47.219 --> 1:22:48.649
Only the known

1:22:49.188 --> 1:22:50.708
is tolerable.

1:22:50.856 --> 1:22:52.976
And we know nothing

1:22:53.158 --> 1:22:56.958
of what this child will become.

1:22:58.497 --> 1:23:01.727
Can we live with such uncertainty?

1:23:04.603 --> 1:23:07.233
Spare ourselves a fight today,

1:23:09.341 --> 1:23:11.041
only to die

1:23:12.177 --> 1:23:14.147
- tomorrow.

ARO: My dear, dear Alice,

1:23:48.447 --> 1:23:51.747
we're so glad to see you here, after all.

1:23:51.884 --> 1:23:54.794
I have evidence the child
won't be a risk to our kind.

1:23:56.722 --> 1:23:57.882
Let me show you.

1:23:58.657 --> 1:23:59.657
Brother?

1:24:05.498 --> 1:24:06.728

1:24:25.585 --> 1:24:27.415
It doesn't matter what I show you.

1:24:29.422 --> 1:24:30.722
Even when you see.

1:24:32.158 --> 1:24:34.518
You still won't change your decision.

1:24:35.662 --> 1:24:36.722
Now!

1:24:47.907 --> 1:24:49.307
Take care of my daughter.

1:24:55.215 --> 1:24:56.235
Get them.

1:25:14.867 --> 1:25:16.097
Hmm!

1:25:23.876 --> 1:25:25.276
Take her away.

1:25:27.547 --> 1:25:28.837
Let her go!

1:32:10.621 --> 1:32:12.021
Finally.

1:34:04.369 --> 1:34:05.529
Now you know.

1:34:06.538 --> 1:34:07.868
That's your future.

1:34:09.074 --> 1:34:11.344
Unless you decide on another course.

1:34:11.910 --> 1:34:15.240
We cannot alter our course.
The child still poses a grave threat.

1:34:15.881 --> 1:34:17.011
EDWARD: But what if you were sure she could

1:34:17.115 --> 1:34:18.875
remain concealed from the human world?

1:34:19.417 --> 1:34:20.977
Could we leave in peace?

1:34:21.086 --> 1:34:23.146
Of course. But that cannot be known.

1:34:24.089 --> 1:34:25.419
Actually, it can.

1:35:03.929 --> 1:35:06.329
I've been searching for witnesses of my own

1:35:06.431 --> 1:35:08.401
among the Ticuna tribes of Brazil.

1:35:08.568 --> 1:35:10.648
- We have enough witnesses.
- Let him speak, brother.

1:35:12.205 --> 1:35:13.395
I am half human,

1:35:14.207 --> 1:35:15.397
half vampire.

1:35:16.475 --> 1:35:17.525
Like the child.

1:35:18.911 --> 1:35:20.711
A vampire seduced my mother,

1:35:21.147 --> 1:35:22.907
who died giving birth to me.

1:35:23.249 --> 1:35:24.409
My aunt Huilen

1:35:25.718 --> 1:35:27.048
raised me as her own.

1:35:29.055 --> 1:35:30.385
I made her immortal.

1:35:31.991 --> 1:35:33.421
How old are you?

1:35:36.896 --> 1:35:38.796
150 years.

1:35:40.099 --> 1:35:42.929
At what age did you reach maturity?

1:35:43.236 --> 1:35:46.596
I became full-grown
seven years after my birth.

1:35:48.007 --> 1:35:49.407
I have not changed since then.

1:35:54.647 --> 1:35:56.207
And your diet?

1:35:56.382 --> 1:35:57.542
Blood,

1:35:57.650 --> 1:35:58.710
human food.

1:35:59.819 --> 1:36:01.219
I can survive on either.

1:36:01.921 --> 1:36:05.761
These children are much like us.

1:36:06.125 --> 1:36:08.985
Regardless, the Cullens have been
consorting with werewolves.

1:36:09.095 --> 1:36:10.525
Our natural enemies.

1:36:23.609 --> 1:36:24.699
Dear ones,

1:36:26.612 --> 1:36:28.912
there is no danger here.

1:36:31.017 --> 1:36:32.607
We will not fight

1:36:33.119 --> 1:36:34.119
today.

1:37:02.215 --> 1:37:03.975
Such a prize.

1:37:08.322 --> 1:37:11.312
We have them on the run.
Now is the time to attack.

1:37:11.558 --> 1:37:12.648
Not today.

1:37:16.129 --> 1:37:17.649
You're all fools!

1:37:17.965 --> 1:37:19.485
The Volturi might be gone.

1:37:20.033 --> 1:37:21.833
But they will never forgive

1:37:22.402 --> 1:37:23.702
what happened here.

for a long time, isn't she?

1:38:40.615 --> 1:38:41.835
I'm glad she has you.

1:38:50.691 --> 1:38:52.391
So should I start calling you "Dad"?

1:38:54.228 --> 1:38:55.228
No.

1:38:57.865 --> 1:38:58.865
Hey.

1:39:02.537 --> 1:39:03.537
Hey.

1:39:15.550 --> 1:39:18.350
Yeah. We're all gonna be together now.

1:39:57.759 --> 1:39:59.229
I wanna show you something.

1:40:01.797 --> 1:40:02.797
What?

1:40:33.395 --> 1:40:34.985
I'm Edward Cullen.

1:41:33.289 --> 1:41:34.589
How did you do that?

1:41:36.192 --> 1:41:37.422
Been practicing.

1:41:40.363 --> 1:41:41.593
Now you know.

1:41:44.901 --> 1:41:48.101
Nobody's ever loved anybody
as much as I love you.

1:41:49.606 --> 1:41:51.366
There's one exception.

1:42:02.452 --> 1:42:03.782
Will you show me again?

1:42:05.455 --> 1:42:06.945
We've got a lotta time.

1:42:09.092 --> 1:42:10.422
Forever.

1:42:13.463 --> 1:42:14.563
Forever.
