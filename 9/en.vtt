31:17.875 --> 31:19.958
-Jane.
-Hi.

31:20.041 --> 31:22.125
Don't tell me you two know each other.

31:23.375 --> 31:25.333
Bobby, this is my dad.

31:28.125 --> 31:29.750
Have you two had intercourse?

31:29.833 --> 31:31.708
[laughs] What?

31:31.791 --> 31:33.166
Hey, uh, Bobby.

31:33.750 --> 31:35.500
Uh, can you give us a minute?

31:37.083 --> 31:40.125
[indistinct radio chatter]

31:41.666 --> 31:44.666
After I talk to Taggart,
I will tell you everything that I know.

31:45.250 --> 31:46.166
Okay?

31:50.291 --> 31:51.583
Chief!

31:51.666 --> 31:54.000
Chief John Taggart.

31:54.083 --> 31:55.833
You son of a bitch.

31:55.916 --> 31:58.208
How dare you pull this crap on me, huh?

32:00.041 --> 32:01.041
-[groans]
-[laughing]

32:01.125 --> 32:03.250
Damn! I missed you, brother. [laughing]

32:03.333 --> 32:05.291
Man, what the fuck
are you still doing here?

32:05.375 --> 32:08.125
-Why haven't you retired?
-Well, I did you know, but, uh,

32:08.208 --> 32:11.333
Maureen and I
got back together and trust me,

32:11.416 --> 32:13.250
home is the last place I want to be.

32:13.333 --> 32:15.000
-Ah. [chuckles]
-[laughs]

32:15.083 --> 32:17.416
Oh, sorry. Cade Grant. Axel Foley.

32:17.500 --> 32:18.333
Hey.

32:18.416 --> 32:19.833
Grant used to be one of us.

32:19.916 --> 32:23.208
Now he runs the interdepartmental
narcotics task force.

32:23.291 --> 32:26.375
I've been hearing
Axel Foley stories since the academy.

32:26.458 --> 32:29.208
Used to be you'd get a couple of toddies
into old Taggart here,

32:29.291 --> 32:30.791
he would go on for hours.

32:30.875 --> 32:33.208
What brings you back to 90210?

32:33.291 --> 32:36.041
Well, I got a call
from my old friend Billy.

32:36.125 --> 32:40.500
Ah, Billy.
This case has him all twisted up.

32:40.583 --> 32:42.208
Now he's got Janey involved,

32:42.291 --> 32:45.041
following his cockamamie
conspiracy theories.

32:45.125 --> 32:47.208
I mean, he's always
had a nose for that kind of thing.

32:47.291 --> 32:51.041
Axel. Your daughter's
defending a goddamn cop killer.

32:51.125 --> 32:53.541
I'm sorry. Jane Saunders is your daughter?

32:53.625 --> 32:55.750
Yeah. She is. A cop killer?

32:55.833 --> 32:56.666
Yeah.

32:56.750 --> 33:00.500
She took on a kid named Enriquez.
Killed an undercover named Copeland.

33:00.583 --> 33:03.583
Wow. I… This is the first time
I'm hearing this shit.

33:03.666 --> 33:05.916
Your daughter claims Copeland was dirty.

33:07.041 --> 33:08.291
Well, how well do you know Copeland?

33:08.375 --> 33:11.833
Well, he came up through the BHPD so, uh…

33:11.916 --> 33:13.375
enough to know it's horseshit.

33:13.458 --> 33:15.208
Yeah, Copeland was one of mine, Foley.

33:15.291 --> 33:18.333
I can say
without hesitation that he's clean.

33:18.416 --> 33:20.666
He was a smart cop too. Family man.

33:20.750 --> 33:23.125
Shit, the guy coaches Little League.

33:23.750 --> 33:24.833
He was the real deal.

33:25.666 --> 33:26.958
Well, I'm sorry.

33:27.500 --> 33:29.500
The job asks a lot, doesn't it?

33:32.041 --> 33:33.583
Well, I'll leave you guys to it.

33:33.666 --> 33:34.750
Yeah, man.

33:36.541 --> 33:37.833
-Hi.
-Hey.

33:40.000 --> 33:41.041
How have you been?

33:41.125 --> 33:41.958
Good.

33:43.250 --> 33:44.291
You look good.

33:44.375 --> 33:46.583
Thanks. You too.

33:47.208 --> 33:48.500
Come on. I'll walk you out.

33:48.583 --> 33:49.625
Okay.

33:51.458 --> 33:52.625
You seeing anybody?

33:53.958 --> 33:56.083
Uh, I don't know that I want
to get into that with you.

33:56.166 --> 33:58.458
Okay. Fair enough.

34:00.250 --> 34:03.666
Look, I'm sorry. I… sort of disappeared.

34:03.750 --> 34:05.000
Don't worry about it.

34:06.250 --> 34:07.708
So, that's your dad?

34:07.791 --> 34:09.250
He's not my dad.

34:09.333 --> 34:10.166
[Bobby] Oh.

34:10.250 --> 34:13.083
I mean, he's… he's my dad.
He hasn't been a dad.

34:13.166 --> 34:14.500
Got it.

34:14.583 --> 34:15.583
What?

34:15.666 --> 34:18.958
Well, it kind of makes sense, I guess.

34:19.041 --> 34:20.000
Which part?

34:20.083 --> 34:23.583
Him being a cop. Putting away criminals.
You doing what you do.

34:23.666 --> 34:25.625
Are you attempting to read me again?

34:25.708 --> 34:27.500
I would never attempt such a thing.

34:27.583 --> 34:30.416
-Should I lay on your couch, Dr. Abbott?
-Oh, my God…

34:30.500 --> 34:33.041
I mean, I had these really
wild dreams last night.

34:33.125 --> 34:34.875
-Should we lean in?
-[laughs]

34:38.041 --> 34:41.750
You know, me and my dad,
we didn't have the best thing either.

34:41.833 --> 34:43.333
I'm sorry. We never…

34:44.708 --> 34:47.166
-We never got there.
-Yeah.

34:47.250 --> 34:51.541
-I just know family can be complicated.
-Yeah, it sucks.

34:52.208 --> 34:53.083
Yeah.

34:56.500 --> 34:58.708
-[Axel] Hey Jane, wait…
-[Jane] This was a mistake.

34:58.791 --> 35:01.416
[Axel] Hey, look, Rosewood was
down at the impound the other night.

35:01.500 --> 35:02.791
Can you think of a reason why?

35:02.875 --> 35:05.125
[Jane] Right now I can't think
of a reason I'm even talking to you.

35:05.208 --> 35:07.541
Look, some guys
was ripping his office apart,

35:07.625 --> 35:09.500
and that guy I just met,
the Honorable Captain Grant,

35:09.583 --> 35:11.375
he's the first
police captain that I ever seen

35:11.458 --> 35:13.916
in two thousand dollar Gucci shoes.
Something is up.

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
Now, why might Rosewood
have been down at the impound?

35:16.833 --> 35:20.000
-Copeland's car is in there.
-Really?

35:20.083 --> 35:21.583
Now, when's the last time
you talked to him?

35:22.208 --> 35:23.291
It was after--

35:23.375 --> 35:26.333
You know what? I'm not doing this.
I got you out. You're welcome.

35:26.416 --> 35:29.166
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute now.
It was after what, Jane?

35:29.250 --> 35:31.333
Hey, look, Rosewood could be in trouble.

35:31.416 --> 35:34.333
What he was looking for down there might
be able to exonerate your client, right?

35:34.416 --> 35:35.250
Yes.

35:35.333 --> 35:37.166
Okay, well just take me
down to the impound

35:37.250 --> 35:40.333
and tomorrow I will get on the plane
and fly back to Detroit.

35:41.458 --> 35:43.791
-Then we can go back to being…
-Estranged.

35:43.875 --> 35:44.958
What's that, French?

35:45.666 --> 35:47.541
-I'mma drive.

35:47.625 --> 35:49.083
Okay, you drive then.

Hey, look, I know
there's some things we need to talk--

36:12.208 --> 36:15.625
Hey, here are the rules.
No personal stuff. Okay?

36:15.708 --> 36:19.166
Okay, I get it. I get it.
It's just that, you know,

36:19.250 --> 36:21.875
I had to move you out of Detroit.
It wasn't safe.

36:22.541 --> 36:25.250
The 12th Street Mafia
vowed to execute my family.

36:25.333 --> 36:27.583
So, I got my family safe.

36:27.666 --> 36:30.208
Because the 12th Street Mafia
are some scary motherfuckers.

36:30.291 --> 36:34.416
Did the 12th Street Mafia tell you
to get a divorce and stay in Detroit?

36:34.500 --> 36:35.708
No, that was your mother.

36:35.791 --> 36:38.875
She's ten times worse

is accused of killing a cop?

36:42.833 --> 36:45.583
-He didn't do it.
-Well, how can you be so sure?

36:45.666 --> 36:48.958
Because he's just a kid who got
talked into muling cocaine for his uncle.

36:49.041 --> 36:50.166
Who's the uncle?

36:50.250 --> 36:53.083
Some big dealer
on the east side named Chalino.

36:53.166 --> 36:54.875
So you're claiming Copeland is dirty.

36:54.958 --> 36:56.375
Yes.

36:56.458 --> 36:57.833
Just don't make no sense.

36:58.416 --> 37:00.333
If Copeland worked
for Chalino running dope,

37:00.416 --> 37:01.875
why would Chalino kill him?

37:01.958 --> 37:03.916
Can you put the case file down, please?

37:04.000 --> 37:06.333
-Hey, you still have your gun?
-No.

37:06.416 --> 37:09.083
-You don't go to the range anymore?
-No.

37:09.166 --> 37:11.208
And I've also forgotten
how to escape a trunk,

37:11.291 --> 37:13.041
get out of handcuffs,
do a front and follow

37:13.125 --> 37:16.708
and all the other crazy cop
bullshit you tried to cram into my brain.

37:16.791 --> 37:20.500
Hey, look, Jane, a few years back,
I had some therapy.

37:21.125 --> 37:22.500
You went to therapy?

37:23.125 --> 37:25.791
Now, why is that so shocking
that I went to therapy?

37:27.333 --> 37:29.666
Well, actually, no,
I didn't go to therapy.

37:29.750 --> 37:31.083
But I read some shit online.

37:32.500 --> 37:34.250
Hey, look,
the point that I'm trying to make

37:34.333 --> 37:37.125
is that when I do something
like try to teach you

37:37.208 --> 37:40.000
how to get out of handcuffs,
that's the same as another parent

37:40.083 --> 37:43.625
when they take their kids to the ball game
or give their kids a Slinky, you know?

37:43.708 --> 37:46.791
Sometimes a parent'll do something
because they don't know

37:46.875 --> 37:50.083
how to express stuff with words.
So they do things. See what I'm saying?

37:50.166 --> 37:53.041
And so what is he saying
when he stops trying?

37:54.000 --> 37:55.041
See what I'm saying?

38:16.875 --> 38:17.750
Help you?

38:17.833 --> 38:19.375
I certainly hope so.

38:19.458 --> 38:24.250
I'm Axel Foley, producer of the new
Liam Neeson revenge thriller, Impound.

We're actually in the market
for a new technical advisor.

38:27.625 --> 38:29.291
We're hoping you're our guy.

38:29.375 --> 38:30.291
Tech advisor, huh?

38:30.375 --> 38:33.000
Yeah. I'm not really interested
in anything behind the camera.

38:33.625 --> 38:35.875
-Pass.
-I totally understand.

38:39.500 --> 38:40.500
Hey, wait a minute.

38:40.583 --> 38:43.166
Are you an actor?
I feel like I've seen you in something.

38:43.250 --> 38:45.583
I knew it. I knew it I'd seen--
What have I seen you in?

38:45.666 --> 38:47.416
Probably Jupiter Ascending.

38:47.500 --> 38:49.041
I played Sargorn Number Four…

38:49.125 --> 38:52.125
Yes! Sargorn Number Four!
Of course. You were fantastic!

38:52.208 --> 38:55.708
-Wow! Thank you. Thank you so much.
-Amazing stuff. Such good work.

38:55.791 --> 38:57.375
Well, you know,
I got a lot of help from Channing.

38:57.458 --> 38:58.666
-Did you now?
-Tatum.

38:58.750 --> 39:00.375
So, what's the story about?

39:01.000 --> 39:03.500
-Okay, so it's about this--
-No, no! You were in it.

39:03.583 --> 39:05.458
You're the star. Let's hear you tell it.

39:06.541 --> 39:08.375
-Oh, you want me to tell. Oh, you want--
-Yeah.

39:08.458 --> 39:11.041
Well… [chuckles]
It's all-- It was, uh…

39:11.125 --> 39:14.583
It's-- It's Jupiter.
It's Jupiter, and it's, um…

39:15.750 --> 39:16.583
Ascending?

39:16.666 --> 39:18.125
That's it. Oh, you kidding me?

39:26.833 --> 39:28.916
-Yeah.
-You are Father Kilgore.

39:29.000 --> 39:31.166
Father Kilgore's actually
the hero of the piece.

39:31.791 --> 39:33.833
-I can't believe this is happening.
-This is so fucking exciting.

39:33.916 --> 39:34.750
I'm so excited.

39:34.833 --> 39:39.375
The movie starts off with Liam Neeson
breaking into a police impound yard.

39:39.458 --> 39:42.416
Wait a minute. Whoa.
We just had a break-in last night.

39:42.500 --> 39:43.958
[mock gasp] Did you really?

39:44.041 --> 39:45.583
-Swear to God.
-Just last night?

39:45.666 --> 39:47.333
-It's on this camera. Watch.
-I don't believe it.

39:47.416 --> 39:48.583
Check this out.

39:48.666 --> 39:52.750
Look, see? So weird.
It's like he knew you were coming.

39:52.833 --> 39:54.166
-This happened last night?
-Last night.

39:54.250 --> 39:56.166
-Just last fucking night.
-And you just happened to…

39:56.250 --> 39:59.125
What's that word? Kismet?
This is kismet. This is a kismet--

39:59.208 --> 40:01.041
-I think we're in alignment.
-The stars aligned, exactly.

40:01.125 --> 40:04.333
This is some kismet shit for your ass.
So, they broke in last night.

40:04.416 --> 40:07.291
Hey, I was wondering, you think
you could maybe bring the dogs in

40:07.375 --> 40:10.000
so we can go out and have a look?
For research.

40:10.083 --> 40:11.083
Okay. Sure.

40:11.166 --> 40:13.333
We're gonna do some research, Father.

40:15.875 --> 40:18.791
This is just like Detroit Impound.

40:18.875 --> 40:20.583
Except for everything.

40:23.583 --> 40:24.958
That's Copeland's car.

40:27.416 --> 40:29.583
This hit another vehicle.

40:29.666 --> 40:31.083
See the paint transfer?

40:32.541 --> 40:34.833
Sam said the attackers
were in a black SUV.

40:34.916 --> 40:36.166
See? That checks out.

40:47.500 --> 40:48.500
[Axel] Wait a minute.

40:53.666 --> 40:56.666
Somebody installed a surveillance camera.

40:56.750 --> 40:58.625
A cheap one too.

40:58.708 --> 41:02.625
SD card is missing.
This must be what Rosewood was after.

41:03.250 --> 41:04.875
This doesn't add up.

41:05.583 --> 41:08.416
There's nothing in the police report
about a camera in the car.

41:09.041 --> 41:09.916
[Axel] So this means…

41:10.000 --> 41:13.750
[Jane] It means there's video footage
of Copeland's murder on that SD card.

41:13.833 --> 41:16.375
That's what they
were looking for in Billy's office.

41:16.458 --> 41:19.083
You know, you've got a really
good knack for putting things together.

41:19.166 --> 41:21.916
-You think maybe it might be in the blood?
-Don't… Don't do that.

41:22.000 --> 41:24.416
-Don't do what?
-Bond. Don't try to…

41:24.500 --> 41:25.958
-No bonding?
-No.

41:26.041 --> 41:27.750
All right. No bonding.

41:27.833 --> 41:30.458
-We are being followed.
-How do you know?

41:30.541 --> 41:32.166
Well, what would you do if you were them

41:32.250 --> 41:34.000
and you didn't find
what you were looking for?

41:34.083 --> 41:36.625
Me? I would tail us
and hope that we led them to it.

41:36.708 --> 41:38.625
Hey, you got one of those
little lady mirrors?

41:38.708 --> 41:40.541
No. Why?

41:53.083 --> 41:54.583
We got a fan club.

42:00.041 --> 42:01.166
Let's go.

42:02.500 --> 42:04.958
Hey, pull up over there.
Let's see who's following us.

42:06.000 --> 42:07.583
Get me a little closer there.

42:08.666 --> 42:10.333
[cell phone ringing]

42:10.416 --> 42:11.916
-[Jane] Hi.
-[man] Hi, Miss Saunders.

42:12.000 --> 42:13.833
I have a Mr. George Romslo returning.

42:13.916 --> 42:15.166
Thank you, Brad.
Tell him I'll call him back.

42:15.250 --> 42:16.958
-You got it.
-Okay, bye.

42:17.583 --> 42:18.708
In there.

42:24.291 --> 42:25.875
[motor switches off]

42:30.166 --> 42:31.541
It's them.

42:32.333 --> 42:34.125
Those two guys from Rosewood's office.

42:40.833 --> 42:42.500
Where the fuck are they?

42:43.291 --> 42:44.625
They should be right in front of us.

42:46.500 --> 42:47.666
[sighs]

42:47.750 --> 42:48.666
Shit!

43:00.458 --> 43:03.083
So, hey, was it difficult making this, uh…

43:03.166 --> 43:04.125
Was what difficult?

43:04.208 --> 43:05.666
-The name change.
-Oh.

43:05.750 --> 43:07.416
I noticed you
changed your name to Saunders.

43:07.500 --> 43:09.208
-Mm-hm.
-Was that an easy transition?

43:10.041 --> 43:11.083
Yeah.

43:11.166 --> 43:13.250
You gotta fill a lot of papers out
to be Saunders.

43:13.333 --> 43:14.958
Yeah, you have to be pretty determined.

43:15.041 --> 43:16.541
Saunders, Saunders, Saunders.

43:18.416 --> 43:21.958
Is it as cool as Foley though?
Foley make me smile when I say it.

43:22.041 --> 43:23.166
"Look, it's Foley."

43:24.333 --> 43:25.875
-[Axel] No?
-[Jane] Is there more?

43:25.958 --> 43:27.208
Foley just sounds strong.

43:27.291 --> 43:30.291
It's punchier
and it has a crispier thing to it.

43:30.375 --> 43:32.291
[with force] Foley. Jane Foley.

43:32.375 --> 43:33.625
[weakly] Jane Saunders.

43:33.708 --> 43:34.916
"Excuse me, how do you spell your name?"

43:35.000 --> 43:38.708
[weakly] S-A-U-N

43:38.791 --> 43:41.791
D-E-R-S.

43:43.291 --> 43:44.708
Saunders.

43:44.791 --> 43:46.375
[giggling]

43:52.875 --> 43:54.250
[Jane] Well, okay.

43:57.541 --> 44:00.041
-What is this place?
-The Eastern.

44:00.666 --> 44:04.166
Hey, they're not going to let you up.
It's a private social club.

44:05.375 --> 44:07.833
["La Manera De Vivir" by NOYSE and ÆSTRØ
playing faintly]

44:09.000 --> 44:10.333
[indistinct chatter]

44:15.166 --> 44:18.875
Good evening.
May I have your member number, sir?

44:19.500 --> 44:24.500
Yes. My member number is
LAFD Fire Marshal. 17484.

44:24.583 --> 44:26.708
And this is a surprise inspection.

44:26.791 --> 44:28.833
How's that fit you, Fancy Dan?

44:29.458 --> 44:33.375
What did you say your name was?
Because Chief Sullivan was here recently.

44:33.458 --> 44:36.166
If you keep up that attitude,
I'll shut this whole place down right now.

44:36.250 --> 44:39.916
You know what?
Could I see your badge again?

44:40.000 --> 44:42.166
No, actually you can't.
Because I don't know you,

44:42.250 --> 44:44.250
and a lot of badges
have been getting snatched in this area.

44:44.333 --> 44:45.583
Now I'm not going to take my badge out…

44:45.666 --> 44:47.958
Okay, I'm going to go ahead and
call Chief Sullivan.

44:48.041 --> 44:51.041
You can go ahead and call Sullivan.
I don't think he'd answer though.

44:51.625 --> 44:55.625
Given he just retired, by which I mean
he was fired for being drunk on the job.

44:56.458 --> 44:58.625
Oh, I had no idea.

44:58.708 --> 45:00.083
He urinated on the wall.

45:00.166 --> 45:02.458
We've done our best
to keep it out of the press.

45:02.958 --> 45:05.833
Dorothy Hrbek, special liaison
to the mayor's office. How are you?

45:06.708 --> 45:08.000
-Well.
-Good.

45:08.625 --> 45:11.625
Can you tell me
the maximum capacity upstairs?

45:11.708 --> 45:12.666
Eighty-five.

45:12.750 --> 45:13.750
Eighty-five persons?

45:13.833 --> 45:15.291
-Eighty-five people? Very good.
-Very good.

45:15.375 --> 45:18.291
So, if we were to go upstairs right now
there wouldn't be more than 85 people?

45:18.375 --> 45:20.125
Wouldn't be no 86 would not be up there?

45:20.208 --> 45:22.875
-No, ma'am.
-Then you have nothing to worry about.

45:22.958 --> 45:24.750
If I were you, I'd let us go up there,
take a headcount,

45:24.833 --> 45:27.458
check out the fire extinguishers
and we'll be on our merry way.

45:27.541 --> 45:29.000
On our merry way.

45:29.916 --> 45:32.125
I don't have a problem with that.

45:32.791 --> 45:33.958
Thank you, Fancy Dan.

45:35.000 --> 45:36.166
I hope it's 85.

45:37.083 --> 45:40.208
[overlapping chatter, laughter]

45:40.291 --> 45:43.541
[Axel] The special liaison
to the mayor's office. Very nice.

45:43.625 --> 45:46.333
-You were flailing.
-No, I was setting shit up.

45:46.958 --> 45:48.041
It was hard to watch.

45:48.125 --> 45:50.708
Really? Cause that's not
what I saw on your face.

45:51.375 --> 45:53.208
I felt like you were transfixed
by what I was doing.

45:53.291 --> 45:55.000
Watching Daddy at work.

45:57.250 --> 45:58.083
Hey.

46:08.541 --> 46:09.750
Hey, guys.

46:10.666 --> 46:11.875
I owe you all an apology.

46:11.958 --> 46:14.750
Because that was not Wesley Snipes
in the picture, that was me.

46:15.666 --> 46:16.791
And sorry about that too.

46:16.875 --> 46:18.916
I didn't know it was gonna
swell up like that.

46:19.000 --> 46:20.291
You should've iced it.

46:20.375 --> 46:22.458
Okay. Give us a minute. Will you, guys?

46:26.208 --> 46:29.666
Sorry about that, Foley.
Miss Saunders. Good to see you.

46:29.750 --> 46:31.875
So, those were your guys, how about that?

46:31.958 --> 46:35.500
Hey, can I get you guys anything?
Anything at all? Drink?

46:35.583 --> 46:38.083
George makes a pretty wicked mojito.

46:38.166 --> 46:39.166
No, thank you.

46:39.250 --> 46:40.750
Hey, what were they doing at Rosewood's?

46:40.833 --> 46:46.291
Billy Rosewood removed--
stole a crucial piece of evidence

46:46.375 --> 46:49.916
that I need to continue
my investigation into your case.

46:50.000 --> 46:52.750
They're not cops.
How does that work, Captain?

46:53.375 --> 46:57.916
Well, used to be you could get around
a warrant with a little creative writing,

46:58.000 --> 46:59.958
but in the current climate,

47:00.041 --> 47:03.125
we have to be so careful about
everything we say, everything we do.

47:03.208 --> 47:07.125
It helps to have somebody
outside the official chain of command.

47:07.208 --> 47:10.000
Shit, you know what
I'm talking about, right, Axel?

47:10.083 --> 47:13.500
In this instance, I guess it sounds
like they went slightly overboard.

47:14.125 --> 47:17.125
Yeah, you could say they went slightly
overboard since they tried to kill me.

47:17.208 --> 47:20.791
From what Taggart tells me,
you're no altar boy yourself.

47:21.416 --> 47:25.000
But you do get the pressure
that I'm under here, right?

47:25.583 --> 47:27.000
Mayor's office is all over me.

47:27.083 --> 47:30.958
I need to recover that evidence
to exonerate Copeland

47:31.041 --> 47:33.958
and I will do whatever it takes
to get it back.

47:34.041 --> 47:36.208
His family deserves as much.

47:36.291 --> 47:41.166
Or Enriquez. Right, Captain?
His family deserves as much, too.

47:42.333 --> 47:44.375
You know, I like seeing this.

47:44.458 --> 47:46.208
The two of you together.

47:46.291 --> 47:49.875
Working as a team.
Father and daughter. Wow.

47:49.958 --> 47:53.333
It's just so impressive
how you've been able to maintain

47:53.416 --> 47:57.375
such a vibrant relationship,
even though she protects

47:57.458 --> 48:00.666
the same people that you've
spent your life trying to put away.

48:00.750 --> 48:03.875
I'm just amazed it doesn't get to you.

48:04.500 --> 48:08.416
I mean, criminals sure,
but we're talking about cop killers here.

48:09.625 --> 48:11.875
How does that sit with you, huh?

48:11.958 --> 48:14.833
We put our lives on the line every day.

48:15.625 --> 48:18.916
It's a war out there. We deserve more.

48:19.541 --> 48:20.958
Like that Rolex you got on.

48:22.166 --> 48:25.208
Gold Daytona. Isn't she a beauty?

48:25.291 --> 48:29.458
Yeah. You put it best when you said
that this job asks a lot from us.

48:29.541 --> 48:31.833
Never really gives anything back.

48:31.916 --> 48:33.166
Not like that, anyway.

48:34.041 --> 48:35.541
Must be a Beverly Hills thing.

48:35.625 --> 48:36.916
[chuckles]

48:37.000 --> 48:40.208
All I know is, I earned it
and I'm going to enjoy it.

48:41.625 --> 48:43.625
Hey, thanks for stopping by.

48:43.708 --> 48:46.750
As far as I'm concerned,
it's been an absolute pleasure.

48:55.083 --> 48:58.250
Thousand dollar shoes,
Rolex watch. Come on, now.

48:58.333 --> 49:01.875
I seen crooked cops before,
but this guy is fucking next level.

49:02.750 --> 49:03.833
What do you think?

49:04.958 --> 49:06.833
-You want my opinion?
-Yeah, I do.

49:07.583 --> 49:09.458
One, Grant knows
what happened to Copeland.

49:09.541 --> 49:10.375
Check.

49:10.458 --> 49:14.416
Two, Grant knows we know,
which means he doesn't care.

49:14.500 --> 49:16.916
-So either, A, he's stupid…
-Which he's not.

49:17.000 --> 49:19.958
…or B, he's powerful.
Which means he's dangerous.

49:20.791 --> 49:24.041
You see how that works?
You see great minds working together?

49:24.125 --> 49:26.208
-Foley and Foley?
-Saunders.

49:26.291 --> 49:28.583
Exactly. Foley and Saunders.

49:31.583 --> 49:33.750
You think Grant's right, though,
don't you?

49:34.250 --> 49:36.208
-About what?
-About me.

49:37.041 --> 49:39.458
I saw the way you were
looking at me while he was talking.

49:39.541 --> 49:41.875
Well, Jane, you did
choose to represent criminals.

49:41.958 --> 49:45.083
So I chose to become
a defense attorney to piss you off?

49:45.166 --> 49:47.666
No, I didn't say that,
but let's not sit here and pretend

49:47.750 --> 49:49.500
it's not the cherry on top of the cake.

49:49.583 --> 49:53.083
Nothing I've done is because of you.
Why? Because you weren't there.

49:53.166 --> 49:57.041
Hey, look, we both messed this thing up.
All right? Let's just call it even.

50:03.083 --> 50:04.625
I believe that's your rental.

50:05.125 --> 50:07.625
-Yeah, but we're not done here.
-We're done here.

50:11.500 --> 50:14.666
Go back to Detroit.
We'll talk in another five years.

50:15.291 --> 50:18.083
And just so you know,
if you had went to therapy,

50:18.166 --> 50:22.541
the parent is always the parent.
The child is always the child.

50:22.625 --> 50:25.375
We didn't mess this up.
You messed this up. Goodbye.

50:29.416 --> 50:30.250
Okay.

50:50.250 --> 50:52.083
[Billy] You've reached
Rosewood Investigations.

50:52.166 --> 50:53.708
Please leave a message.

50:53.791 --> 50:56.666
Hey, Billy, where you at? Call me.

51:09.833 --> 51:11.041
May I help you, sir?

51:11.125 --> 51:14.625
Uh, yes. I'm Nigel Applebottom
with Bon Appétit.

51:14.708 --> 51:16.333
-Mmm.
-And I was wondering…

51:18.041 --> 51:20.791
You know, to hell with this.
I'm just too tired.

51:20.875 --> 51:22.708
Do you have any rooms available?

51:22.791 --> 51:24.666
[typing]

51:24.750 --> 51:27.541
You're in luck.
I've got a beautiful resort view room.

51:27.625 --> 51:30.041
-Oh, great. I'll take that.
-Wonderful.

51:30.125 --> 51:32.583
The rate is 940 dollars a night plus tax.

51:33.750 --> 51:34.958
I love Beverly Hills.

52:03.833 --> 52:06.291
Your 10:30 is here to see you.
Main conference.

52:06.375 --> 52:09.958
Partners want you on this.
Oil execs. Spill off the coast of Alaska.

52:10.041 --> 52:11.375
Possible settlement.

52:11.458 --> 52:14.458
-Client requested you personally for this.
-Let me call you back. Okay.

52:14.541 --> 52:16.250
Let me call you back. Okay.

52:17.375 --> 52:19.083
-Name?
-Red Michaels.

52:19.666 --> 52:21.791
Red Michaels…

52:21.875 --> 52:23.541
Mr. Michaels.

52:23.625 --> 52:25.291
Please call me Red.

52:26.083 --> 52:30.208
What? What are you doing?
You said you were leaving town.

52:30.291 --> 52:32.666
Red Michaels never runs from a fight.

52:33.166 --> 52:34.625
[sighs]

52:34.708 --> 52:36.833
I need you to get him out of here.
Call security if you have to.

52:36.916 --> 52:38.291
-I'll be in my office.
-Hey. Jane.

52:39.083 --> 52:40.500
Take a look at this.

52:44.333 --> 52:46.333
I took that out of Rosewood's diary.

52:48.583 --> 52:49.791
That mean anything to you?

52:49.875 --> 52:52.458
I was there earlier today.
They had a lot of security

52:52.541 --> 52:54.375
even for Beverly Hills.

52:54.458 --> 52:56.041
And guess who else was there?

52:57.250 --> 52:58.791
The guys from last night.

52:58.875 --> 53:01.958
Yes. These guys are dangerous, Jane.

53:02.041 --> 53:04.291
Okay, if you don't want me
to be with you, fine.

53:04.375 --> 53:07.166
But you gotta at least have a detail.
Let me get you a gun.

53:07.250 --> 53:09.625
I've got to talk to Sam.
He's not telling me something.

53:09.708 --> 53:11.958
-Why don't you let me talk to him?
-Not a chance.

53:12.041 --> 53:14.416
-Why not?
-Because you're not a lawyer.

53:15.041 --> 53:16.750
But I look like a lawyer.

53:16.833 --> 53:19.916
You look like you sell iPhone cases
to teenagers at the mall.

53:20.000 --> 53:21.541
What?

53:21.625 --> 53:24.791
Look, Jane, this is what I do.
This is my life, okay?

53:24.875 --> 53:27.125
One street kid to another,
I can get him to talk.

53:27.208 --> 53:28.500
[sighs heavily]

53:28.583 --> 53:31.375
Okay, and then you go to the airport.

53:31.458 --> 53:34.625
I want you out of the city. I want you
out of my business. I want you gone.

53:34.708 --> 53:35.958
Deal.

53:37.083 --> 53:40.333
I also want you out of this suit.
What is this? Where did you get that?

53:40.416 --> 53:43.416
I got this suit in Hollywood.
This suit is fly.

53:43.500 --> 53:46.041
They wanted $50 for this suit.
I got it for $39.99.

53:46.125 --> 53:46.958
It's yikes.

53:47.041 --> 53:49.750
For $39.99,
this suit is off the chain, Jane.

53:49.833 --> 53:50.791
Hey, that rhymed.

53:50.875 --> 53:55.000
Now, wait a minute, I can't take
the thyroid pill with the liver pill?

53:55.083 --> 53:57.541
-Is that right?
-[rapping on glass]

53:58.291 --> 54:02.291
Yeah, well, Jesus Christ, Maureen.
Relax. I haven't even taken them yet.

54:02.375 --> 54:06.166
And what could go wrong, anyway?
My liver's already clinically dead.

54:06.250 --> 54:07.541
Listen, I gotta go.

54:08.791 --> 54:11.125
-That the Copeland file?
-Yes it is.

54:11.208 --> 54:12.416
It looks open.

54:12.500 --> 54:16.333
And at this point, it should be
Blockbuster Video fucking closed.

54:16.416 --> 54:17.750
I just came from the impound.

54:17.833 --> 54:20.250
Did you know that
there was a surveillance camera

54:20.333 --> 54:21.583
installed on Copeland's car?

54:21.666 --> 54:24.666
Doesn't surprise me.
Part of an undercover operation.

54:24.750 --> 54:27.666
Right. But no one on the task force
was going to let me know about it,

54:27.750 --> 54:29.250
seeing as it's my case?

54:29.333 --> 54:30.333
Detective…

54:31.166 --> 54:35.875
Your extremely high-profile homicide
turned out to be a self solver.

54:35.958 --> 54:39.000
So if I were you,
I would count my blessings

54:39.083 --> 54:42.916
and stop trying to be
so fucking interesting. Got it?

54:46.958 --> 54:49.333
I'm really sorry, sir.
But can you just look at it?

54:53.958 --> 54:56.083
-It's not Department issue.
-Correct.

54:56.166 --> 54:57.416
Where's the SD card?

54:57.500 --> 55:00.541
Exactly. Your old partner
broke into the impound

55:00.625 --> 55:05.000
and then just yesterday, Axel Foley
shows up there, and he's poking around.

55:05.083 --> 55:07.250
So it seems to me, sir, that things
are getting a little more interesting

55:07.333 --> 55:08.583
all by themselves.

55:09.500 --> 55:11.125
[sighs]

55:11.208 --> 55:12.041
[whispers] Fuck.

55:12.125 --> 55:13.375
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

55:14.375 --> 55:16.291
[Billy] You've reached
Rosewood investigations.

55:16.375 --> 55:17.875
Please leave a message.

55:17.958 --> 55:19.041
[Axel] Voicemail.

55:21.041 --> 55:24.458
Keep trying to come up with a reason
why he'd stay off the grid for so long.

55:25.833 --> 55:29.416
-Rosewood doesn't scare easily.
-Yeah, that's what has me worried.

55:30.208 --> 55:31.583
[exhales]

55:33.958 --> 55:35.250
We got company again.

55:35.958 --> 55:38.041
It's your boy Bobby back there tailing us.

55:38.125 --> 55:39.125
Not my boy.

55:39.750 --> 55:40.750
Yeah, he is your boy.

55:40.833 --> 55:43.125
I saw you two look at each other
back at the station.

55:51.333 --> 55:54.625
So just to be clear, you guys used to be
in a relationship and you're not anymore?

55:54.708 --> 55:58.208
Okay, and just to be clear on this,
you are still single.

55:58.291 --> 56:01.458
-In fact, I'm a celibate.
-Oh, I didn't need to know that.

56:05.541 --> 56:07.583
There are some things
I need to say to you

56:07.666 --> 56:09.750
that haven't been said
that I think I should say.

56:09.833 --> 56:12.083
-Oh, gosh, is this a speech?
-No, it's not a speech.

56:12.166 --> 56:13.583
I'm talking from the heart.

56:13.666 --> 56:16.625
You're my only child, right?

56:16.708 --> 56:20.250
And I've only been a father
as long as you've been a daughter.

56:20.833 --> 56:23.250
I'm making this up as we go along.
We both are.

56:23.333 --> 56:25.875
When you was five, I was a dad five years.

56:25.958 --> 56:28.958
When you was ten,
to when you were 20, and now you're…

56:31.666 --> 56:35.125
-No, go on. Give it a shot.
-Well, I know how old you are.

56:38.125 --> 56:40.500
[indistinct radio chatter]

56:41.958 --> 56:44.083
One hundred bucks says, you do not know

56:44.166 --> 56:46.416
-how old your only daughter is.
-Excuse me. Is that what you think?

56:46.500 --> 56:48.875
Come on, let's try it.
On the count of three. One…

56:49.458 --> 56:51.583
[in Spanish] The Bronco. On the right.

56:52.666 --> 56:53.583

58:46.666 --> 58:48.125
Yeah. You all right?

58:48.208 --> 58:49.875
-[panting] I'm fine.
-You okay?

58:51.708 --> 58:54.625
Your birthday is March 24th
and you're 32 years old.

58:54.708 --> 58:56.708
[sirens approaching]

58:59.500 --> 59:01.166
[Axel] Hey, nice shot back there.

59:02.166 --> 59:03.416
Thanks. Appreciate it.

59:03.500 --> 59:06.416
If you hadn't have done it,
I was about to do it myself.

59:07.041 --> 59:09.291
You have a hard time admitting
when you need help, huh?

59:09.375 --> 59:11.208
Are you doing your
concerned therapist thing for me?

59:11.291 --> 59:12.916
I'm just saying,
maybe that has something to do

59:13.000 --> 59:14.583
with your strained relationship with Jane.

59:14.666 --> 59:18.666
Hey, you don't know anything about
my relationship with Jane, all right?

59:19.333 --> 59:21.875
So, what about
your relationship with Jane?

59:21.958 --> 59:24.333
We don't have one.
She broke it off with me.

59:24.416 --> 59:27.958
And I'm not afraid to say that.
She ended it, but you want to know why?

59:28.041 --> 59:31.125
-I got a lot of ideas.
-She said she couldn't date a cop.

59:37.375 --> 59:38.791
Who were these guys?

59:39.708 --> 59:42.250
Cartel kill crew out of Adelanto.

59:42.333 --> 59:44.250
Bunch of them got arrested
here back in October.

59:44.333 --> 59:46.208
Let me guess, Rosewood made the arrests.

59:46.291 --> 59:50.333
Yeah. Case went nowhere.
Charges dropped for lack of evidence.

59:50.416 --> 59:52.541
Because the supervisor
on the case was Grant.

59:53.666 --> 59:56.916
-How do you know that?
-Foley! Get your ass in here.

59:57.000 --> 59:58.375
Excuse me.

59:58.458 --> 01:00:02.875
Suddenly, these-- these gangsters
came at us with assault weapons.

01:00:02.958 --> 01:00:05.541
I couldn't believe it! In Beverly Hills!

01:00:05.625 --> 01:00:07.750
And Manolo saved the day.

01:00:07.833 --> 01:00:09.916
-He barked…
-Taggart, I know you're pissed

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.458
but I think you might want
to take a look at this.

01:00:11.541 --> 01:00:12.791
You know what I think?

01:00:13.458 --> 01:00:16.458
I think three days ago,
I was feeling pretty goddamn good.

01:00:16.541 --> 01:00:19.791
Hell, I was only waking up three
or four times a night to take a piss.

01:00:20.666 --> 01:00:24.750
And today,
my blood pressure's up 40 points.

01:00:24.833 --> 01:00:27.833
Well, your skin looks fantastic.
Whatever you're doing is working.

01:00:29.958 --> 01:00:31.166
Oh, shit.

01:00:32.958 --> 01:00:35.875
-Billy worked months on this case.
-Yeah, the same guys.

01:00:35.958 --> 01:00:37.958
They should have been locked up,
but they walked.

01:00:38.041 --> 01:00:41.291
Well, we tested the dope. It was powder.

01:00:41.375 --> 01:00:44.000
Billy accused Grant
of swapping out the real shit.

01:00:44.083 --> 01:00:46.458
Swore up and down Grant was dirty.

01:00:46.541 --> 01:00:48.541
I told him, "Hey, it doesn't add up."

01:00:48.625 --> 01:00:51.375
But you know Billy. He wouldn't let it go.

01:00:51.458 --> 01:00:53.541
Ended up pissing a lot of people off.

01:00:53.625 --> 01:00:55.833
Well, it comes with the job
if you're doing it right.

01:00:55.916 --> 01:00:58.625
Well, he ended up
turning in his badge over it.

01:00:58.708 --> 01:01:00.541
Blamed me for not having his back.

01:01:00.625 --> 01:01:03.750
But look, I know Grant.

01:01:03.833 --> 01:01:05.958
He's good police.

01:01:06.041 --> 01:01:08.333
I trained him, for Christ's sake.

01:01:08.416 --> 01:01:11.041
He was my boot, when I was still
pushing a black and white.

01:01:11.125 --> 01:01:13.416
And Billy was your partner for 30 years.

01:01:13.500 --> 01:01:15.458
And he's in fucking trouble now, Taggart.

01:01:16.083 --> 01:01:17.625
Hey, come on, man.

01:01:17.708 --> 01:01:19.000
Hey, wait a minute.

01:01:20.125 --> 01:01:21.875
Are you part of this shit, man?

01:01:23.208 --> 01:01:24.958
How could you even ask me that?

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.083
After four decades of friendship?

01:01:29.041 --> 01:01:32.833
-What do you want from me, Axel?
-I want you to start being a cop again.

01:01:34.875 --> 01:01:37.000
Get out of my fucking office now.

01:01:37.083 --> 01:01:39.333
Go back to fucking Detroit
where you belong!

01:01:39.958 --> 01:01:40.791
Abbott!

01:01:41.500 --> 01:01:44.916
God damn it! Come here! What is this shit?

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:48.208
You're turning Beverly Hills
into goddamn Ciudad Juarez.

01:01:48.291 --> 01:01:50.666
It was an ambush.
What was I supposed to do?

01:01:50.750 --> 01:01:52.833
You're suspended. Without pay.

01:01:52.916 --> 01:01:56.958
Pending an investigation
on your handling of the Copeland homicide.

01:01:57.041 --> 01:01:59.083
Turn in your badge and your gun. Now!

01:01:59.166 --> 01:02:01.875
I guess you don't want
to solve this one, huh, Chief?

01:02:02.916 --> 01:02:04.666
You just want to manage it.

01:02:05.958 --> 01:02:07.625
Son of a bitch.

01:02:12.833 --> 01:02:14.916
-What did he say?
-We're on our own.

01:02:16.041 --> 01:02:18.625
And you seriously
don't want to give it up?

01:02:18.708 --> 01:02:20.333
After what just happened?

01:02:20.416 --> 01:02:21.750
I know that was scary.

01:02:21.833 --> 01:02:24.750
But from my experience, Jane,
that means we're getting close.

01:02:24.833 --> 01:02:26.166
Close to what?

01:02:26.250 --> 01:02:28.583
I'm a lawyer, not a cop.
I don't do shootouts.

01:02:28.666 --> 01:02:32.291
Nobody else is gonna help your client,
and nobody else is going to find Rosewood.

01:02:32.375 --> 01:02:33.500
We're it.

01:02:33.583 --> 01:02:36.083
Well that's almost true,
except it's my case.

01:02:36.750 --> 01:02:38.750
I happen to have
some free time on my hands now.

01:02:38.833 --> 01:02:40.916
-Suspended?
-Yeah.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.625
-Let me guess. It's your first time?
-Yes, it is.

01:02:43.708 --> 01:02:46.833
Well, congratulations. I do some
of my best work when I'm suspended.

01:02:46.916 --> 01:02:50.333
Yeah, I'm really thrilled to be here.
Now, what else haven't you told me?

01:02:56.500 --> 01:02:57.333
Chamomile?

01:02:57.416 --> 01:02:58.791
Thank you.

01:02:58.875 --> 01:03:00.041
How you feeling?

01:03:01.041 --> 01:03:02.250
[inhales deeply]

01:03:03.625 --> 01:03:05.875
[sharp exhale] Um… I'm okay.

01:03:05.958 --> 01:03:08.208
-[laughs]
-Why?

01:03:08.958 --> 01:03:11.208
Today was a lot. I'm just checking on you.

01:03:12.458 --> 01:03:15.250
Hey! Where's all the sugar in this place?

01:03:15.333 --> 01:03:16.416
I'll get it for you.

01:03:18.666 --> 01:03:20.208
All right. So, I pulled a favor

01:03:20.291 --> 01:03:23.708
and found out the house
was bought last August, all cash.

01:03:23.791 --> 01:03:26.333
You know where
the sugar drawer is and everything, huh?

01:03:26.416 --> 01:03:28.125
Very comfortable here.

01:03:28.208 --> 01:03:30.125
Maybe a little too comfortable.

01:03:30.208 --> 01:03:31.375
Who bought the house?

01:03:31.458 --> 01:03:34.791
A trust called Ocean Equities, LLC.

01:03:34.875 --> 01:03:38.291
They bought and sold a bunch of high-end
houses over the last five years.

01:03:38.375 --> 01:03:40.666
Their bank account's
at the Century City branch,

01:03:40.750 --> 01:03:42.416
Financiero Culiacán.

01:03:42.500 --> 01:03:45.833
Culiacán. Well, that's definitely
the cartel laundering their drug money.

01:03:45.916 --> 01:03:48.166
What does this have to do
with Copeland's murder?

01:03:48.250 --> 01:03:49.250
That is unclear.

01:03:49.333 --> 01:03:52.833
No, it's not. Rosewood knew
something was up with that house.

01:03:52.916 --> 01:03:56.000
The house next door is for sale.
I noticed that when I was casing it.

01:03:56.083 --> 01:03:58.416
We get in there
and maybe I could sneak over.

01:03:58.500 --> 01:04:00.041
That sounds legal.

01:04:01.166 --> 01:04:03.041
All right.
So, the house is available to show.

01:04:03.125 --> 01:04:04.583
Appointment only.

01:04:04.666 --> 01:04:07.166
I think I know somebody
that can get us in.

01:04:20.833 --> 01:04:22.250
[laughing] Hey, Serge!

01:04:23.291 --> 01:04:26.083
-Hey! Hey good to…
-[smooching]

01:04:26.166 --> 01:04:28.291
Okay, all right. All right, okay.

01:04:28.375 --> 01:04:30.458
Look, this is Jane. Remember Jane?

01:04:31.041 --> 01:04:32.500
This… This cannot be Jane.

01:04:32.583 --> 01:04:34.000
[Axel] That's Jane.

01:04:34.083 --> 01:04:37.000
She's so gorgeous!
Do you even remember me?

01:04:37.625 --> 01:04:39.750
You're impossible to forget, Serge.

01:04:40.416 --> 01:04:42.333
-And this is Bobby.
-Detective Abbott.

01:04:42.416 --> 01:04:43.791
Oh, eh… it's what?

01:04:43.875 --> 01:04:45.375
Detective Abbott.

01:04:45.458 --> 01:04:46.500
Hab-at?

01:04:47.458 --> 01:04:49.166
A… A habit? Habity?

01:04:49.250 --> 01:04:50.500
-Abbott.
-Abbott.

01:04:50.583 --> 01:04:51.916
Ah, Abbot. Abbot. Abbot?

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.333
Abbott. Detective Abbott.
Ab. Butt.

01:04:55.875 --> 01:04:57.875
Serge. Ah…

01:04:57.958 --> 01:04:59.375
-What?
-Ahh… mmmm.

01:04:59.958 --> 01:05:01.666
-[Jane] Mm?
-[Serge] Mmm…

01:05:02.291 --> 01:05:03.166
I feel…

01:05:03.250 --> 01:05:05.791
I feel the… the chemistry.

01:05:06.625 --> 01:05:08.958
-You feel what?
-The chemistry between the two…

01:05:09.041 --> 01:05:10.916
-The chemist-tray?
-The negative and the magnetism?

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.083
Ah! Uh, the chemistry!

01:05:13.166 --> 01:05:16.000
-[Serge] How long have you been together?
-Oh, no. [chuckles] We're not together.

01:05:16.083 --> 01:05:17.083
Anymore.

01:05:18.125 --> 01:05:23.125
I'm on an undercover mission
with Ach-well Foley and I'm so happy.

01:05:24.291 --> 01:05:28.833
Ach-well, those two
look so cute together. So hot.

01:05:28.916 --> 01:05:31.500
They're like
two little tee-tee muhng-kees.

01:05:31.583 --> 01:05:32.458
Like two little what?

01:05:32.541 --> 01:05:33.750
Tee-tee muhng-kees.

01:05:33.833 --> 01:05:35.958
-Titty monkeys?
-They mate for life.

01:05:36.041 --> 01:05:37.666
[Axel] Them monkeys don't sound right.

01:05:37.750 --> 01:05:40.458
Maybe you should come up with
some other shit than titty monkeys.

01:05:40.541 --> 01:05:42.041
You can't be calling Black folks monkeys.

01:05:42.125 --> 01:05:44.041
Even with that accent,
you'll get fucked up.

01:05:49.041 --> 01:05:52.125
Serge. Oh, my God! You look fantastic!

01:05:52.208 --> 01:05:54.208
[Serge] Shut up! You do!

01:05:54.291 --> 01:05:55.666
-You shut up!
-Shut up!

01:05:55.750 --> 01:05:57.375
-Shut up!
-Shut up!

01:05:57.458 --> 01:05:58.625
Y'all both need to shut up.

01:05:58.708 --> 01:06:01.583
[laughing] And who's this?

01:06:01.666 --> 01:06:03.666
These are my clients
that I told you about.

01:06:03.750 --> 01:06:06.208
The absolutely astounding couple.

01:06:06.833 --> 01:06:08.625
Thank you so much for fitting us in.

01:06:08.708 --> 01:06:11.333
I'm Jacqueline
and this is my husband, Chad.

01:06:11.416 --> 01:06:16.083
And this is the very, very rich
and successful father-in-law.

01:06:16.166 --> 01:06:19.625
Oh, well, hello, Daddy. [laughs]

01:06:19.708 --> 01:06:21.541
Oh, so what are you in the market for?

01:06:21.625 --> 01:06:25.500
Oh, just trying to find the perfect place
for my girl and her little man.

01:06:25.583 --> 01:06:26.791
[woman] Tsk! Aw…

01:06:26.875 --> 01:06:28.958
And I don't want
to talk out of school, but…

01:06:29.708 --> 01:06:31.000
maybe Jackie you want to tell her.

01:06:31.083 --> 01:06:33.125
-Tell her what?
-That you're pregnant.

01:06:33.208 --> 01:06:34.541
[woman gasps]

01:06:34.625 --> 01:06:37.791
-I'm gonna be a grandfather!
-Grandpappy Ach-well!

01:06:37.875 --> 01:06:39.166
Oh, "Grandpapa."

01:06:39.250 --> 01:06:42.541
-Pappy is more playful.
-But Papa's better.

01:06:42.625 --> 01:06:46.416
Well, children are such a gift.
Yeah. Unless they're not.

01:06:46.500 --> 01:06:48.583
My own kid's a bit of a loser.

01:06:48.666 --> 01:06:50.750
I mean he's four,
but you can already tell.

01:06:50.833 --> 01:06:52.416
-Oh.
-Yeah, you can tell.

01:06:52.500 --> 01:06:54.000
Glasses, the whole thing. Yeah.

01:06:54.083 --> 01:06:55.875
Isn't it so chic?

01:06:55.958 --> 01:06:58.250
My God, these columns are bitchy.

01:06:58.875 --> 01:07:03.500
Okay, so we have eight bedrooms,
ten bathrooms, a pool, a spa, a sauna…

01:07:03.583 --> 01:07:05.291
-Wait, how many bathrooms did you say?
-Ten.

01:07:05.375 --> 01:07:07.958
-Get the fuck out of here.
-No, I cannot! It's important.

01:07:08.041 --> 01:07:10.666
Because when you have parties
then you have place to have sex.

01:07:10.750 --> 01:07:13.541
-Love parties.
-When were you last at a party like that?

01:07:13.625 --> 01:07:15.208
-Last night.
-Get the fuck out of here.

01:07:15.291 --> 01:07:18.833
No, I cannot.
Because I am tired, I need sauna.

01:07:18.916 --> 01:07:22.208
We should all do a sauna together.
Wouldn't that be cute?

01:07:22.291 --> 01:07:25.375
Why don't you take these two lovebirds
and show them the sauna and make it hot.

01:07:25.458 --> 01:07:27.458
And I have to go call my banker.

01:07:27.541 --> 01:07:29.291
Meet up with us. [giggles]

01:08:05.250 --> 01:08:08.375
You guys are adorable.
I honestly kind of hate it.

01:08:08.458 --> 01:08:11.416
[laughs] No, I'm happy for you.

01:08:11.500 --> 01:08:14.791
I love love and happiness. All that shit.

01:08:14.875 --> 01:08:16.541
This house rules, right?

01:08:16.625 --> 01:08:19.166
-Yeah.
-It's… It's a dream.

01:08:19.250 --> 01:08:21.791
-Do you guys like bathrooms?
-[Jane] We use them.

01:08:21.875 --> 01:08:23.541
[woman] Totally. Same.

01:08:24.666 --> 01:08:25.625
I'm single.

01:08:26.375 --> 01:08:27.333
-[Jane] Oh.
-No.

01:08:27.416 --> 01:08:29.125
Yeah. I mean, I've been dating someone,

01:08:29.208 --> 01:08:31.833
but I found out he'd been
secretly taking pictures of my feet

01:08:31.916 --> 01:08:33.250
and selling them on the Internet.

01:08:33.333 --> 01:08:35.791
-What?
-So, we're figuring it out. Yeah.

01:08:35.875 --> 01:08:37.541
Ooh, check out this walk-in.

01:09:01.541 --> 01:09:02.541
[phone camera clicks]

01:09:06.791 --> 01:09:10.000
Do you think the people who used
to live here actually liked this house?

01:09:10.083 --> 01:09:12.291
Yeah, I think they were like,

01:09:12.375 --> 01:09:13.916
"Let's keep it interesting.

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:15.791
Let's do a little taupe
and a little more taupe

01:09:15.875 --> 01:09:17.541
-and a little baroque and a little taupe.
-[chuckles]

01:09:17.625 --> 01:09:20.583
And if you don't like it,
see yourself out my Caucasian door."

01:09:20.666 --> 01:09:21.875
[laughs]

01:09:21.958 --> 01:09:23.625
Oh, my God! You do accents.

01:09:24.625 --> 01:09:28.250
I'm so sorry. My wife is just passionate
about interior design.

01:09:28.333 --> 01:09:31.625
Oh, my goodness. "Wife."
I keep forgetting. Come here.

01:09:36.208 --> 01:09:38.458
-[Axel] Okay.
-[woman] You guys.

01:09:38.541 --> 01:09:39.625
[Axel] All done.

01:09:39.708 --> 01:09:40.625
So, Ashley.

01:09:40.708 --> 01:09:42.416
So, Axel. [laughs]

01:09:42.500 --> 01:09:44.125
Oh, wait. Oh, my God.

01:09:44.208 --> 01:09:45.791
Axel? Ashley?

01:09:45.875 --> 01:09:47.833
Together, we'd be, "Actually."

01:09:47.916 --> 01:09:49.458
[giggles]

01:09:49.541 --> 01:09:51.041
Are you gonna buy the house?

01:09:51.125 --> 01:09:53.041
Yeah, this house
isn't going to work for us.

01:09:53.125 --> 01:09:55.375
No, we're not gonna buy the house.
It's actually horrible.

01:09:55.458 --> 01:09:56.291
Let's get going.

01:09:56.375 --> 01:09:57.208
-Got some other things to look at.
-[Ashley] Yeah.

01:09:57.291 --> 01:09:58.916
-Thank you so much.
-[Ashley] Ugh, I don't like it either.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.291
-I do like the ceiling.
-It's such a gross house.

01:10:01.833 --> 01:10:04.750
I hate it so much. No, it's fine. Yeah.

01:10:05.875 --> 01:10:07.416
[cell phone ringing]

01:10:08.958 --> 01:10:10.083
Yeah, what's up?

01:10:10.166 --> 01:10:13.041
We got a problem.
Foley was just at the house.

01:10:13.125 --> 01:10:16.041
Jesus Christ!
I told you about this guy.

01:10:16.125 --> 01:10:18.041
Should we call our Sinaloan friends?

01:10:18.125 --> 01:10:20.666
No, we don't need any more bodies.

01:10:20.750 --> 01:10:23.041
We need that goddamned SD card.

01:10:23.125 --> 01:10:25.583
I'll handle it myself.

01:10:27.166 --> 01:10:29.833
One of the black Navigators
was hidden under a tarp.

01:10:30.541 --> 01:10:33.916
This paint transfer
comes from impact with Copeland's car.

01:10:35.958 --> 01:10:37.000
And I found this.

01:10:38.833 --> 01:10:40.166
I've seen these.

01:10:40.250 --> 01:10:42.666
The military uses these
to disrupt cell signals

01:10:42.750 --> 01:10:44.208
so they can't trigger IEDs.

01:10:44.291 --> 01:10:45.708
Or call for help.

01:10:47.250 --> 01:10:49.666
-Your guy was telling the truth.
-So, it's over.

01:10:49.750 --> 01:10:50.708
We're finished.

01:10:50.791 --> 01:10:53.625
It's finished for you, not for me.
I still gotta go back to Taggart.

01:10:53.708 --> 01:10:54.916
Go back to Taggart with what?

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.458
Some sketchy real estate deals
and a couple of paint chips?

01:10:57.541 --> 01:10:59.875
Look, by now Grant knows
that we was at the mansion

01:10:59.958 --> 01:11:01.458
and that the car's been moved already.

01:11:01.541 --> 01:11:04.125
You wanna nail Grant,
we gotta find that SD card.

01:11:04.208 --> 01:11:05.958
And the only one
that knows where that is, is Billy.

01:11:06.041 --> 01:11:08.041
Grant wasn't my target.

01:11:08.125 --> 01:11:09.750
I'm not chasing a killer.

01:11:09.833 --> 01:11:13.625
I was chasing reasonable doubt
in Sam's case, which I have.

01:11:14.791 --> 01:11:18.666
Well, what about Sam's uncle?
What's that guy's name? Chalino?

01:11:18.750 --> 01:11:21.500
Chalino, yeah. He might talk to us

01:11:21.583 --> 01:11:24.333
because Grant is trying
to pin a murder on his nephew.

01:11:24.416 --> 01:11:26.791
Do you guys even
hear yourselves right now?

01:11:26.875 --> 01:11:30.083
I'll be suspended.
You have no jurisdiction. No backup.

01:11:30.166 --> 01:11:31.416
It's time to use the law.

01:11:31.500 --> 01:11:33.708
Bullshit. We gotta try
to talk to this Chalino,

01:11:33.791 --> 01:11:37.333
and we gotta try to find Rosewood.
We gotta do something.

01:11:37.416 --> 01:11:38.708
I'm so stupid.

01:11:38.791 --> 01:11:40.083
This wasn't about me.

01:11:40.166 --> 01:11:42.166
This wasn't about my case.
This was about you.

01:11:42.250 --> 01:11:45.166
Hey, I came to town
because I was worried about your ass.

01:11:45.250 --> 01:11:48.000
You came for the action.
This is what you always do.

01:11:48.083 --> 01:11:50.958
You ride into town
and you try to play big hero.

01:11:51.041 --> 01:11:52.625
Classic Axel Foley.

01:11:52.708 --> 01:11:55.541
Look, I wanted
to be a bigger part of your life.

01:11:55.625 --> 01:11:57.083
I did and I tried.

01:11:57.166 --> 01:11:59.375
-How did you try?
-You pushed me away.

01:11:59.458 --> 01:12:04.083
And you always gave up.
You didn't fight. I am your daughter.

01:12:04.166 --> 01:12:07.166
The only thing
you've ever fought for is your job.

01:12:18.125 --> 01:12:20.958
Look, obviously,
I've never been a father before. But…

01:12:21.041 --> 01:12:23.333
So it means whatever you're
about to say is irrelevant.

01:12:23.958 --> 01:12:26.250
I can tell you that when my dad

01:12:26.333 --> 01:12:29.166
moved me and my family to Beverly Hills
from Chicago when I was a kid,

01:12:29.250 --> 01:12:31.916
-I was so pissed at him.
-[laughs]

01:12:32.541 --> 01:12:35.500
-You grew up in Beverly Hills?
-Technically. Yes.

01:12:36.541 --> 01:12:40.083
-What?
-Okay. Now it's all coming into focus.

01:12:40.166 --> 01:12:41.125
Beverly Hills Bobby.

01:12:41.208 --> 01:12:44.833
Look, I don't know why
your daughter seems to hate you so much,

01:12:44.916 --> 01:12:47.958
but I can tell you why I hated my dad.
It's because he was selfish.

01:12:48.041 --> 01:12:50.000
Moved us out here.
We didn't even want to come.

01:12:50.083 --> 01:12:52.875
And then he leaves my mom within the year.

01:12:53.500 --> 01:12:56.750
And he couldn't even see
the toll it took on us until recently,

01:12:56.833 --> 01:13:00.500
just a couple years ago. He called me up,
asked if he could come over.

01:13:00.583 --> 01:13:03.666
He looked me right in the eye
and he apologized.

01:13:04.875 --> 01:13:05.708
Meant a lot.

01:13:06.791 --> 01:13:09.833
I don't owe nobody no apology, all right?

01:13:09.916 --> 01:13:11.750
Jane is the one
that shut me out of her life.

01:13:11.833 --> 01:13:13.750
Not the other way around.

01:13:17.166 --> 01:13:19.375
[Bobby] Talked to a buddy
that works down here.

01:13:19.458 --> 01:13:22.500
He said Chalino's whole operation
is based out of this place.

01:13:22.583 --> 01:13:24.833
So, these guys are gonna be armed.

01:13:25.625 --> 01:13:26.458
You nervous?

01:13:27.500 --> 01:13:29.208
Sure. I mean, I'm fine.

01:13:29.291 --> 01:13:31.125
But I think it's healthy
to be a little bit nervous

01:23:31.041 --> 01:23:32.750
-Let's go! Let's go!
-[exhales deeply]

01:23:32.833 --> 01:23:34.458
This shit is supposed to be
like riding a bike!

01:23:34.541 --> 01:23:36.416
You're supposed to get right in there
and know how to do this shit.

01:23:36.500 --> 01:23:38.833
You was trained. You can do this.
Get going, man. We got to go!

01:23:38.916 --> 01:23:40.666
Please, just shut the fuck up.
I'm trying to concentrate.

01:23:43.041 --> 01:23:45.000
[engines whining]

01:23:46.958 --> 01:23:48.166
Gimme this.

01:23:48.250 --> 01:23:51.458
All units, be advised.
They're on the goddamn roof.

01:23:58.041 --> 01:24:00.416
It's taking off. Go, go, go! Go!

01:24:00.500 --> 01:24:02.375
Fuck, man! I thought
you was supposed to be an elite pilot.

01:24:02.458 --> 01:24:05.833
I was a pilot. But as you pointed out,
I'm not a pilot anymore.

01:24:07.333 --> 01:24:08.250
[officer] Watch it.

01:24:09.541 --> 01:24:11.000
-Man, you look nervous.
-I am nervous.

01:24:11.083 --> 01:24:12.416
Well, why are you so damn nervous?

01:24:12.500 --> 01:24:15.875
I crashed a fucking helicopter, okay?
Got in my head. I haven't flown since.

01:24:15.958 --> 01:24:19.041
-That's why I left LAPD.
-What? Wait…

01:24:20.208 --> 01:24:21.208
[officer] Set it down!

01:24:21.291 --> 01:24:23.166
-Hey! Shit!
-Shit!

01:24:23.250 --> 01:24:25.333
-[Axel and Bobby screaming]
-Oh, shit.

01:24:28.291 --> 01:24:29.500
-[Axel screaming]
-[Bobby grunting]

01:24:30.833 --> 01:24:32.833
[people screaming]

01:24:36.583 --> 01:24:40.000
You fucking crashed a helicopter
and I'm just finding out that just now?

01:24:40.083 --> 01:24:43.416
I'm sorry, I didn't realize the plan
was gonna be to steal a chopper

01:24:43.500 --> 01:24:45.333
off the rooftop
of a fucking police station!

01:24:45.416 --> 01:24:48.291
I didn't realize that you were
so fucked up at flying helicopters.

01:24:48.375 --> 01:24:50.041
Otherwise, I would have
came up with a different idea.

01:24:50.125 --> 01:24:51.541
I told you it was a bad idea!

01:24:51.625 --> 01:24:53.041
[horn blaring]

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:55.250
[tires skidding]

01:24:57.625 --> 01:24:58.750
-Shit!
-What?

01:25:02.041 --> 01:25:05.833
They're under the radar ceiling.
We need to track them from the ground.

01:25:07.125 --> 01:25:08.208
Heading westbound.

01:25:08.291 --> 01:25:09.125
[chopper approaching]

01:25:10.333 --> 01:25:11.625
Oh!

01:25:13.250 --> 01:25:15.583
-What the fuck?
-Will you just shut the fuck up right now?

01:25:15.666 --> 01:25:17.750
-[Axel] Oh, Jesus!
-[Bobby] Shut up!

01:25:17.833 --> 01:25:19.333
[siren wailing]

01:25:22.458 --> 01:25:24.583
What the fuck are these guys doing?

01:25:26.333 --> 01:25:28.375
[voice amplified] Pull over! I mean, land!

01:25:30.208 --> 01:25:31.041
It's Grant!

01:25:38.500 --> 01:25:40.291
-Oh, shit!
-He's shooting at us!

01:25:41.750 --> 01:25:44.375
-I'm about to pass out right now.
-No. No, you ain't!

01:25:44.458 --> 01:25:45.500
Hey! Hey!

01:25:45.583 --> 01:25:46.916
-Oh, God!
-Hey!

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.333
-Man, what the hell?
-Fly this fucking helicopter, right now!

01:25:49.416 --> 01:25:51.000
-Get that gun out of my face!
-I will shoot you in your face

01:25:51.083 --> 01:25:52.041
-if you don't fly this helicopter.
-Fuck!

01:25:52.125 --> 01:25:53.916
I will shoot you then I'mma shoot myself

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:55.708
because I ain't dying
in no helicopter crash.

01:25:56.666 --> 01:25:58.666
Hey, what the fuck? Hey!

01:25:58.750 --> 01:26:00.458
[people shrieking]

01:26:05.208 --> 01:26:07.125
All units, be advised.

01:26:07.208 --> 01:26:09.333
They're heading towards BHPD.

01:26:09.416 --> 01:26:10.875
I'm gonna put this thing down.

01:26:10.958 --> 01:26:12.750
-Here?
-Yeah.

01:26:17.916 --> 01:26:19.166
Jesus Christ!

01:26:19.875 --> 01:26:25.041
Foley! You gotta be shitting me!
You stole a fucking helicopter?

01:26:28.208 --> 01:26:29.791
[panicked yelling]

01:26:33.333 --> 01:26:34.708
Grant!

01:26:37.041 --> 01:26:38.541
Grant back there!

01:26:38.625 --> 01:26:39.458
Fuck!

01:26:44.083 --> 01:26:45.625
Shit, he hit us!

01:26:46.291 --> 01:26:47.458
All right, hang on!

01:26:48.083 --> 01:26:50.708
[both screaming]

01:26:51.416 --> 01:26:53.250
-I don't have my rotor!
-What?

01:26:53.875 --> 01:26:56.375
-He shot my rotor off!
-You have another one?

01:27:00.791 --> 01:27:01.875
-[Axel] Shit!
-[Bobby] Shit! Fuck!

01:27:01.958 --> 01:27:04.541
-[Bobby] Can you be quiet please?
-Oh, shit!

01:27:04.625 --> 01:27:07.250
-I'm just gonna come down hard right now.
-What?

01:27:07.333 --> 01:27:09.000
A hard landing!

01:27:09.083 --> 01:27:12.000
[both screaming]

01:27:13.666 --> 01:27:14.500
[exclaims]

01:27:14.583 --> 01:27:16.666
-Shit!
-Please do not talk right now.

01:27:17.250 --> 01:27:18.500
No, that was good.

01:27:18.583 --> 01:27:20.750
That was-- that was way better
than I would have did.

01:27:21.291 --> 01:27:22.541
Not much better though.

01:27:23.750 --> 01:27:26.666
But way worse than
a real pilot would have did.

01:27:26.750 --> 01:27:28.458
Come on, we gotta go.

01:27:28.541 --> 01:27:30.541
Hey! Excuse me,

01:27:30.625 --> 01:27:32.750
what the hell's going on?

01:27:32.833 --> 01:27:34.583
This is private property.

01:27:34.666 --> 01:27:36.666
We, uh… We got a little problem back here.

01:27:36.750 --> 01:27:39.208
Uh, somebody's still trapped
in the helicopter.

01:27:39.291 --> 01:27:40.916
Yeah, I'd love to help you guys.
Seriously, I would.

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.625
But listen, you put me
in a pretty tight place here.

01:27:43.708 --> 01:27:44.750
Legally speaking. So…

01:27:44.833 --> 01:27:46.875
To hell with all that, man!
A person is dying back there.

01:27:46.958 --> 01:27:48.125
You gotta do something, now!

01:27:48.208 --> 01:27:51.875
Shit! Okay. All right.
Look, I gotta call my attorney

01:27:51.958 --> 01:27:55.625
And my-- my caddie will do it.
Hey, Davis! Come here. Come on.

01:27:55.708 --> 01:27:57.541
-Davis, save us! Help us, Davis.
-Come on.

01:27:57.625 --> 01:28:00.083
There's an old lady in there,
stuck in the helicopter, in the back.

01:28:00.166 --> 01:28:01.125
[golfer] Be a hero.

01:28:01.208 --> 01:28:02.208
Hold your breath. Hold your breath.

01:28:02.291 --> 01:28:03.666
Get a lady out. Get a lady out.

01:28:03.750 --> 01:28:07.208
Hey! Hey! Come on! What are you doing?

01:28:07.833 --> 01:28:09.583
Yeah, we gotta get the hell out of here.

01:28:11.333 --> 01:28:12.875
Hang back. I'm gonna get us a car.

01:28:12.958 --> 01:28:14.291
Grand theft, why not?

01:28:14.375 --> 01:28:16.916
Hey, brother! I'm gonna be real with you.

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.750
We're detectives and we need
to borrow a car real quick

01:28:19.833 --> 01:28:22.375
cause we're in the middle
of a case and it's an emergency.

01:28:22.458 --> 01:28:24.666
-Let me see some ID.
-Well, actually I don't have no ID.

01:28:24.750 --> 01:28:27.750
It's a long story, they trying to frame us
but come on, help a brother out.

01:28:27.833 --> 01:28:29.875
Look, I feel you.
I do, brother. I really do.

01:28:29.958 --> 01:28:31.875
-So you'll lend me a car?
-Fuck no!

01:28:32.500 --> 01:28:34.333
I've been working here
ten years, brother, okay?

01:28:34.416 --> 01:28:36.166
What you want me to do? Huh?

01:28:36.250 --> 01:28:38.666
[stammering] You want me to just
give you a free car 'cause we're brothers?

01:28:38.750 --> 01:28:41.125
Yeah, brother to brother. A brother's
in trouble. A brother's in distress.

01:28:41.208 --> 01:28:44.000
Yeah, but no. So, I lose my job.
What we-- But we cool though right?

01:28:44.083 --> 01:28:45.875
-That's all good?
-Yes, we're brothers! Come on.

01:28:45.958 --> 01:28:49.750
I got three kids and a Labradoodle.
He need hip surgery. That's $43,000.

01:28:49.833 --> 01:28:51.500
I need to pay for that
with this goddamn job.

01:28:51.583 --> 01:28:53.416
Oh, come on, brother.
This is an emergency, brother.

01:28:53.500 --> 01:28:55.625
[mocking] "I'm your brother."
What? Are we at a cookout, nigga? What?

01:28:55.708 --> 01:28:57.791
-You a good man.
-I know I'm a good man.

01:28:57.875 --> 01:29:00.416
You care about your family and your dog.
But we in trouble right now.

01:29:00.500 --> 01:29:01.583
-Brother, come help a brother out.
-Yeah.

01:29:01.666 --> 01:29:03.125
[British accent]
Mrs. Weinstein, how you doing?

01:29:03.208 --> 01:29:04.541
Leave it right there. I'll be right over.

01:29:04.625 --> 01:29:05.458
[normal voice] No!

01:29:05.541 --> 01:29:06.875
-That's how you gonna do it.
-That's called a code switch.

01:29:06.958 --> 01:29:10.250
-Oh, you one of them code switch niggas?
-[in accent] Hello, good to see you!

01:29:11.791 --> 01:29:15.125
Is this what you meant by hanging back?

01:29:15.208 --> 01:29:17.708
Well, okay, Detective Abbott.

01:29:18.500 --> 01:29:20.583
-[car alarm chirps]
-Ah!

01:29:26.208 --> 01:29:27.208
Hey, Uncle John.

01:29:27.791 --> 01:29:28.875
Can you chat?

01:29:29.625 --> 01:29:30.958
Grant arrested them?

01:29:31.041 --> 01:29:32.833
Yeah, then they escaped.

01:29:34.166 --> 01:29:36.083
I got an APB out on the two of them,

01:29:36.166 --> 01:29:38.458
but I don't know
who Grant's got in his pocket.

01:29:38.541 --> 01:29:40.833
-Mm.
-Billy was right about him all along.

01:29:40.916 --> 01:29:42.083
I should have listened to him.

01:29:42.166 --> 01:29:44.708
Your dad hasn't checked in
with you, has he?

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:46.833
Shit.

01:29:48.583 --> 01:29:51.375
I said some things
I shouldn't have said. It wasn't good.

01:29:51.458 --> 01:29:56.708
Stop. He can't always express it,
but he cares about you more than anything.

01:29:59.458 --> 01:30:01.666
-[Axel] It's Axel. Leave a message.
-[beeps]

01:30:01.750 --> 01:30:03.875
[Jane] Hi, I really need to talk to you.

01:30:04.416 --> 01:30:05.916
I said some things.

01:30:06.583 --> 01:30:08.625
Just call me back, I promise I'll answer.

01:30:09.541 --> 01:30:11.041
[car alarm chirps]

01:30:15.208 --> 01:30:16.708
-[gun cocks]
-[gasps]

01:30:17.541 --> 01:30:18.458
Drive.

01:30:19.791 --> 01:30:23.333
[Axel] You know, your boy Chalino could've
been more specific about the location.

01:30:23.833 --> 01:30:27.375
-You think he was lying?
-I don't know. We got to keep looking.

01:30:31.833 --> 01:30:32.916
Hey, what's all this stuff?

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.041
[indistinct shouting]

01:30:35.666 --> 01:30:36.500
Yo.

01:30:38.041 --> 01:30:39.875
That's the truck that came
out of the cartel mansion.

01:30:40.791 --> 01:30:43.166
Those guys do not look like union workers.

01:30:43.250 --> 01:30:45.125
They most certainly do not.

01:30:47.125 --> 01:30:49.625
Hey, that's Rosewood's car right there.

01:30:49.708 --> 01:30:52.875
That blue one with the--
That little top shit on it. Come on.

01:31:23.708 --> 01:31:26.166
[men speaking Spanish]

01:31:35.166 --> 01:31:37.791
All right. Come here.

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:40.041
Yeah, come here.

01:31:40.875 --> 01:31:42.583
I'll tell you where the SD card is.

01:31:44.458 --> 01:31:45.750
I hid the SD card…

01:31:47.625 --> 01:31:49.208
in a little place called…

01:31:51.666 --> 01:31:53.208
"Go fuck yourselves."

01:31:53.291 --> 01:31:54.583
[men grunting]

01:31:55.750 --> 01:31:59.666
-What took you so long?
-Sightseeing. I love LA this time of year.

01:31:59.750 --> 01:32:01.666
Something about
the smog and the smoke

01:32:01.750 --> 01:32:03.666
from the forest fires is magical.

01:32:03.750 --> 01:32:05.625
[painful chuckle] Don't make me laugh.

01:32:05.708 --> 01:32:08.083
-Detective Bobby Abbott.
-Hey. Billy Rosewood.

01:32:08.166 --> 01:32:10.708
Yeah, I know. We gotta move quick.

01:32:11.208 --> 01:32:13.166
They're almost done loading
the rest of the dope onto the last truck.

01:32:13.250 --> 01:32:14.625
Oooh…

01:32:16.750 --> 01:32:18.416
You can never have too much firepower.

01:32:18.500 --> 01:32:21.416
Billy Rosewood. I missed you, buddy.

01:32:22.250 --> 01:32:23.875
[chatter in Spanish]

01:32:37.083 --> 01:32:38.708
[engine cranks, starts]

01:32:38.791 --> 01:32:39.875
[men shouting in Spanish]

01:32:39.958 --> 01:32:42.375
[tires screeching]

01:32:42.458 --> 01:32:44.125

[tires squealing]

01:33:01.916 --> 01:33:03.083
Shit.

01:33:11.416 --> 01:33:12.708
[screams]

01:33:17.166 --> 01:33:18.875
Where the hell did you hide that SD card?

01:33:19.458 --> 01:33:21.750
In my Rambo knife. In my office.

01:33:21.833 --> 01:33:23.041
[Axel] We gotta tell Jane.

01:33:24.833 --> 01:33:26.583
[line ringing]

01:33:26.666 --> 01:33:27.500
Jane.

01:33:27.583 --> 01:33:29.000
Hello, Axel.

01:33:29.791 --> 01:33:31.416
-Grant?
-Yep.

01:33:31.500 --> 01:33:32.500
Hey, where is she?

01:33:32.583 --> 01:33:35.625

01:45:05.250 --> 01:45:08.333
Outstanding. I don't feel
nothing dripping or anything.

01:45:08.416 --> 01:45:10.458
So I'm okay.

01:45:10.541 --> 01:45:11.791
What'd I miss?

01:45:12.416 --> 01:45:14.333
Captain Grant and five others, DOA.

01:45:15.083 --> 01:45:18.250
Uh, three perps are
in the hospital, under watch.

01:45:18.333 --> 01:45:19.500
And your client?

01:45:19.583 --> 01:45:23.750
The judge got the SD card.
District Attorney dropped all charges.

01:45:25.166 --> 01:45:26.291
You're welcome.

01:45:26.375 --> 01:45:28.000
[pained groan]

01:45:28.083 --> 01:45:29.166
You sure you're okay?

01:45:29.250 --> 01:45:31.625
-You know we gotta go back.
-Yeah, I'm fine. I'm good.

01:45:31.708 --> 01:45:35.083
Look, let me say something to you.
You were right.

01:45:36.625 --> 01:45:38.750
When you said
that a parent's always a parent

01:45:38.833 --> 01:45:40.958
and a child's always a child.

01:45:41.041 --> 01:45:43.500
That's real shit. And…

01:45:45.083 --> 01:45:46.666
I really messed that up.

01:45:49.416 --> 01:45:50.375
And I'm sorry.

01:45:53.416 --> 01:45:54.250
Well…

01:45:55.958 --> 01:45:58.000
you know when you said you've…

01:45:59.875 --> 01:46:02.583
you've been a father
as long as I've been a daughter?

01:46:03.333 --> 01:46:05.666
I've never thought about it like that.

01:46:06.291 --> 01:46:09.083
And yes, the parent
does bear the responsibility,

01:46:09.166 --> 01:46:11.083
but I'm an adult now, too.

01:46:14.208 --> 01:46:15.750
Well, do I get another shot at it?

01:46:15.833 --> 01:46:16.916
[chuckles]

01:46:17.583 --> 01:46:19.833
Here's the deal. First, get well.

01:46:20.500 --> 01:46:23.125
Two, when you do call me, we'll talk.

01:46:24.208 --> 01:46:26.583
And I don't know. Maybe you stay longer.

01:46:27.375 --> 01:46:30.250
You always say
they love you in Beverly Hills.

01:46:30.333 --> 01:46:31.791
Okay, that's a deal.

01:46:32.416 --> 01:46:35.250
I am very, very proud of you, Jane.

01:46:35.875 --> 01:46:36.875
I really am.

01:46:40.250 --> 01:46:41.875
Let's get you back, Dad.

01:46:42.500 --> 01:46:47.250
Okay, cool. "Dad."
I like it. I love it. I love it! Yeah!

01:46:47.333 --> 01:46:50.125
-Will you help me up off the stool here?
-Yes.

01:46:50.208 --> 01:46:52.708
Lot easier to sit down
than it is to get up. Just…

01:46:52.791 --> 01:46:54.500
[groaning] There we go.

01:46:55.083 --> 01:46:58.833
"Dad." You know, "Dad"
is just a syllable away from "Daddy."

01:46:58.916 --> 01:47:00.250
Oh, look at you. Here you go.

01:47:00.333 --> 01:47:03.000
Yeah, that's almost--
Look, get your pocketbook.

01:47:03.083 --> 01:47:05.750
"Pocketbook." I suddenly see my future.

01:47:05.833 --> 01:47:07.875
-What?
-You just turned into an 83-year-old.

01:47:07.958 --> 01:47:10.333
Well, I was recently shot,
that's why I'm walking like--

01:47:10.416 --> 01:47:11.333
Don't get it twisted.

01:47:11.958 --> 01:47:14.583
[Jane] You know, you didn't have to
get shot for us to hang out, right?

01:47:14.666 --> 01:47:17.375
[Axel] No, but it helped, though.
You can admit that, right?

01:47:17.458 --> 01:47:18.833
-[horn honking]
-[driver shouting angrily]

01:47:18.916 --> 01:47:20.333
You know, if I didn't get shot

01:47:20.416 --> 01:47:24.208
we wouldn't be walking
across the street together right now.

01:47:24.291 --> 01:47:26.541
[Jane] Just promise not to leave again.

01:47:36.583 --> 01:47:40.666
Sarge, can I ask you something personal?

01:47:41.250 --> 01:47:42.083
No.

01:47:45.666 --> 01:47:50.208
How often do you and Maureen make love?

01:47:51.083 --> 01:47:52.500
Billy, what the fuck?

01:47:52.583 --> 01:47:54.166
It's good for the marriage.

01:47:54.750 --> 01:47:57.416
Get out. Get out
of the car right now. Get out.

01:47:57.916 --> 01:47:59.416
-[Axel] Hey!
-Hey!

01:47:59.500 --> 01:48:01.041
-Jesus!
-Oh!

01:48:01.125 --> 01:48:05.750
You two are
the worst fucking surveillance team

01:48:05.833 --> 01:48:07.833
-that ever lived.
-[John sighing]

01:48:07.916 --> 01:48:09.541
-Ever lived.
-Holy shit.

01:48:09.625 --> 01:48:12.833
It's only been a week. You're supposed
to be resting in the goddamn hospital.

01:48:12.916 --> 01:48:14.708
Yeah, I know,
and y'all supposed to be out here watching

01:48:14.791 --> 01:48:16.625
to make sure
I don't get the hell out of here, right?

01:48:16.708 --> 01:48:19.458
-Jane put y'all up to this, didn't she?
-We're worried about you.

01:48:19.541 --> 01:48:20.916
Don't be worried about me. I'm fine.

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:22.666
I just had to get from up there
for a second.

01:48:22.750 --> 01:48:26.041
Look, up there is nothing but
a bunch of old sick people.

01:48:26.125 --> 01:48:29.500
Everybody's hacking and coughing
and moaning and groaning and shit.

01:48:29.583 --> 01:48:31.208
You would fit in perfect up here, Taggart.

01:48:31.291 --> 01:48:34.625
-Leave me out of this, all right?
-Look, man. I just want to go get a steak.

01:48:34.708 --> 01:48:35.541
-I'm starving.
-No.

01:48:35.625 --> 01:48:37.208
What do you mean, "No?"
I just been eating this hospital food…

01:48:37.291 --> 01:48:39.916
-Axel. No. No way.
-…for a week and I need some real food.

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:42.750
What? I'm not trying to start no shit.
I just want a steak.

01:48:42.833 --> 01:48:44.750
Let's go. Come on, man. Look, you know me.

01:48:44.833 --> 01:48:46.291
You understand me.
You know, I need this, man.

01:48:46.375 --> 01:48:47.500
Don't do it, Billy.

01:48:47.583 --> 01:48:50.666
Sarge. We both know I'm gonna do it.

01:48:52.750 --> 01:48:55.458
-[car starts]
-Oh, fuck it. Let's get a porterhouse.

01:48:55.541 --> 01:48:58.041
-Now we're talking.
-Not getting any younger, you know?

01:48:58.125 --> 01:49:00.416
-Come on, let's do this.
-Not one word to Jane.

01:49:00.500 --> 01:49:01.333
-And that's an order.
-No.

01:49:01.416 --> 01:49:02.875
-Hell no. No.
-Not one word to Jane.

01:49:02.958 --> 01:49:05.750
This is gonna be fantastic. Trust me.
