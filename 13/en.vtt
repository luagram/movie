38:17.380 --> 38:19.880
Are you... I'm older than you,

38:19.966 --> 38:23.296
so that makes me the influencer
and you the influencee.

38:23.386 --> 38:24.966
(LAUGHS) No, no, no.

38:25.054 --> 38:28.814
My size and knowledge base
actually makes me older than you

38:28.891 --> 38:31.391
because of your general paleness
and lack of know-how.

38:31.477 --> 38:33.977
I convinced you to build
two-wheeled death machines with me.

38:34.063 --> 38:37.613
Don't you think that makes you
kind of young and naive?

38:37.692 --> 38:39.902

38:40.903 --> 38:43.863

<i>White demon, widen your heart's scope</i>

2:06:41.303 --> 2:06:47.943
<i>White demon, who let your friend go?</i>

2:07:03.993 --> 2:07:08.213
<i>Stand it any more, darling</i>

2:07:09.373 --> 2:07:10.713
<i>Stand it</i>

2:07:16.213 --> 2:07:18.553
<i>(MEET ME ON THE EQUINOX PLAYING)</i>

2:07:19.717 --> 2:07:23.637
<i>Meet me on the equinox</i>

2:07:23.721 --> 2:07:26.471
<i>Meet me halfway</i>

2:07:26.557 --> 2:07:29.847
<i>When the sun is perched at its highest peak</i>

2:07:29.935 --> 2:07:33.685
<i>In the middle of the day</i>

2:07:33.772 --> 2:07:37.192
<i>Let me give my love to you</i>

2:07:37.735 --> 2:07:40.445
<i>Let me take your hand</i>

2:07:40.904 --> 2:07:44.334
<i>As we walk in the dimming light</i>

2:07:44.408 --> 2:07:47.578
<i>Oh, darling, understand</i>

2:07:47.995 --> 2:07:52.955
<i>That everything, everything ends</i>

2:07:55.044 --> 2:08:00.634
<i>That everything, everything ends</i>

2:08:05.929 --> 2:08:09.639
<i>Meet me on your best behavior</i>

2:08:09.725 --> 2:08:12.595
<i>Meet me at your worst</i>

2:08:12.686 --> 2:08:16.226
<i>For there will be no stone unturned</i>

2:08:16.315 --> 2:08:19.275
<i>Or bubble left to burst</i>

2:08:19.943 --> 2:08:23.533
<i>Let me lay beside you, darling</i>

2:08:24.031 --> 2:08:27.031
<i>Let me be your man</i>

2:08:27.117 --> 2:08:30.537
<i>And let our bodies intertwine</i>

2:08:30.621 --> 2:08:34.121
<i>But always understand</i>

2:08:34.208 --> 2:08:39.458
<i>That everything, everything ends</i>

2:08:41.215 --> 2:08:46.965
<i>That everything, everything ends</i>

2:08:48.263 --> 2:08:54.983
<i>That everything, everything, everything ends</i>

2:08:58.899 --> 2:09:01.489
<i>A window</i>

2:09:02.444 --> 2:09:06.164
<i>An opened tomb</i>

2:09:06.240 --> 2:09:08.990
<i>The sun crawls</i>

2:09:09.076 --> 2:09:12.696
<i>Across your bedroom</i>

2:09:13.163 --> 2:09:15.333
<i>A halo</i>

2:09:16.667 --> 2:09:20.207
<i>A waiting room</i>

2:09:20.295 --> 2:09:23.215
<i>Your last breaths</i>

2:09:23.298 --> 2:09:25.878
<i>Moving through you</i>

2:09:25.968 --> 2:09:31.218
<i>As everything, everything ends</i>

2:09:32.808 --> 2:09:38.398
<i>As everything, everything, everything</i>

2:09:38.480 --> 2:09:44.900
<i>Everything, everything, everything ends</i>

2:09:50.742 --> 2:09:54.542
<i>Meet me on the equinox</i>

2:09:54.913 --> 2:09:57.503
<i>Meet me halfway</i>

2:09:57.583 --> 2:10:01.043
<i>When the sun is perched at its highest peak</i>

2:10:01.128 --> 2:10:04.378
<i>In the middle of the day</i>

2:10:04.923 --> 2:10:08.843
<i>Let me give my love to you</i>

2:10:08.927 --> 2:10:11.467
<i>Let me take your hand</i>

2:10:12.055 --> 2:10:15.305
<i>And as we walk in the dimming light</i>

2:10:15.392 --> 2:10:18.562
<i>Oh, darling, understand</i>

2:10:18.729 --> 2:10:25.239
<i>That everything, everything ends</i>
