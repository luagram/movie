00:15.140 --> 00:16.640
Fluffy!

00:16.641 --> 00:19.601
<i>Man, look at this crowd.</i>

00:19.602 --> 00:22.855
<i>They are going crazy for this guy.</i>

00:22.856 --> 00:24.440
<i>Who is he?</i>

00:24.441 --> 00:27.110
<i>Why are they losing their minds?</i>

00:27.944 --> 00:31.780
<i>Well, I guess we're just gonna
have to go back to the beginning</i>

00:31.781 --> 00:33.240
<i>and figure it out.</i>

00:33.241 --> 00:37.411
<i>Editor, please do me a favor
and take us back to the beginning.</i>

00:38.580 --> 00:41.999
<i>Uh, you know what? I think
you might have gone a little too far.</i>

00:42.000 --> 00:45.252
<i>Yeah. Okay. Yeah, I get it.
Last special. Performed at a stadium.</i>

00:45.253 --> 00:46.879
<i>Mexican Taylor Swift over here.</i>

00:46.880 --> 00:48.839
<i>Okay. Uh... I... You went a li...</i>

00:48.840 --> 00:50.050
<i>Hello? That's... a lot...</i>

00:51.051 --> 00:52.051
<i>Uh, you went...</i>

00:52.052 --> 00:54.386
<i>All right. Real funny, editor.</i>

00:54.387 --> 00:56.055
<i>Real funny.</i>

00:56.056 --> 00:58.558
<i>When I said go back to the beginning,
this isn't what I meant.</i>

00:59.225 --> 01:02.478
<i>But seriously, how long is this special?</i>

01:02.479 --> 01:05.856
<i>Oh. Okay, well,
we'll rewind it just that amount,</i>

01:05.857 --> 01:08.817
<i>and let's give these people

We're in Miami, bitch!

02:22.267 --> 02:23.392
Yeah. Freaking Miami.

02:23.393 --> 02:25.686
This is the only place
I could pull this off.

02:26.980 --> 02:28.605
I can't wear this in LA. They're like,

02:28.606 --> 02:30.984
"I'm blind!"

02:31.484 --> 02:33.027
"It's too much."

02:33.945 --> 02:36.948
Ah, freaking Mexican DJ Khaled up here.
I know, right?

02:39.159 --> 02:41.661
Also, I would like to thank,
since we're here,

02:42.162 --> 02:43.745
Only in Dade.

02:43.746 --> 02:45.290
Thank you so much.

02:49.961 --> 02:51.670
If you know, you know...

02:53.173 --> 02:55.132
...and I think you know.

02:56.759 --> 02:59.845
And also, to my friends
over at La Carreta for all the food. So...

03:02.724 --> 03:03.849
Yes.

03:05.602 --> 03:06.769
Yeah, man.

03:07.562 --> 03:09.021
Before we get started, you guys,

03:09.022 --> 03:13.859
uh, I would like to thank
the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino

03:13.860 --> 03:20.407
for the opportunity to record a special.

03:20.408 --> 03:24.036
No other entertainer
has done a special here yet.

03:24.037 --> 03:25.829
Tonight is the first one.

03:30.585 --> 03:33.503
It wasn't the Rolling Stones.
It wasn't the Eagles.

03:33.504 --> 03:35.672
They trusted a comedian...

03:37.133 --> 03:38.342
...to make this happen.

03:38.343 --> 03:39.801
So I wanna say thank you.

03:39.802 --> 03:43.096
Is anybody else staying here
at the, uh... at the Hard Rock?

03:45.099 --> 03:46.558
Hey, me too.

03:47.769 --> 03:50.187
This is a beautiful hotel,

03:50.188 --> 03:52.689
and I'm not just saying that
'cause my room is free.

03:55.985 --> 03:59.947
You know you're in a nice hotel and casino
when you turn on your TV in your room

03:59.948 --> 04:01.490
and they have their own video.

04:01.491 --> 04:04.910
Like, if you're staying here,
you turn on the TV, you get this,

04:05.954 --> 04:10.499
"Welcome
to the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino."

04:16.464 --> 04:22.095
"Twenty-four-hour gambling,
seven days a week, 365 days a year."

04:28.309 --> 04:31.271
I'm sitting there like,
"Why can't I stop watching this?"

04:32.647 --> 04:33.689
And I started thinking,

04:33.690 --> 04:36.901
at this point, why don't they just do that
to the slot machines?

04:37.986 --> 04:39.987
You know? Gambling's already shameless.

04:39.988 --> 04:41.864
Might as well go all the way.

04:42.740 --> 04:45.367
You walk up to one of the little machines,
pop in a 20.

05:02.093 --> 05:04.553
"Don't stop."
"I'm not gonna."

05:05.805 --> 05:07.973
People are walking by.
"What are you doing?"

05:07.974 --> 05:10.977
"Trying to get the jackpot!"

05:13.438 --> 05:16.732
Yeah, man. I'm gonna start
the show off tonight with a question.

05:16.733 --> 05:20.485
That's not how comedy shows happen,
but I'm gonna start it with a question.

05:20.486 --> 05:21.737
The question is,

05:21.738 --> 05:28.161
who here tonight has never heard of me
up until tonight?

05:31.831 --> 05:32.665
Five.

05:34.083 --> 05:36.168
Two. Five. Okay.

05:36.169 --> 05:39.297
To those of you,
the five of you, I say, "Sorry."

05:40.882 --> 05:42.966
I know you got excited.
You saw the ticket.

05:42.967 --> 05:45.218
You saw the last name,
and then I walked out.

05:45.219 --> 05:47.387
And you're like, "Enrique got bigger."

05:55.355 --> 05:58.607
The only reason why I ask
who has never seen or heard of me before

05:58.608 --> 06:03.403
is because if you have,
then you know the type of show that I do.

06:03.404 --> 06:07.324
And you know the type of show
that I <i>don't</i> do.

06:07.325 --> 06:11.870
Like, I'm not here to tell you
who to vote for, who not to vote for,

06:11.871 --> 06:13.955
what shot to take
or what baby to get rid of.

06:13.956 --> 06:15.458
That's not for me to say.

06:16.250 --> 06:18.502
If you're already offended,
you missed the point.

06:18.503 --> 06:20.796
I'm telling you what I'm <i>not</i> gonna do.

06:20.797 --> 06:25.675
I promise you, I am here to entertain,
not offend. Okay?

06:29.555 --> 06:31.431
We're gonna have fun with everybody.

06:31.432 --> 06:32.599
Starting with me,

06:32.600 --> 06:35.435
but I'm gonna let you know,
we're living in a different time.

06:35.436 --> 06:37.437
I've been doing this so long,

06:37.438 --> 06:39.940
I always figured,
as long as I'm being nice,

06:39.941 --> 06:43.902
I shouldn't have any issues,
but it's a very different time.

06:43.903 --> 06:46.530
This is year 27 for me.

06:47.824 --> 06:49.075
Yeah.

06:50.118 --> 06:52.619
Twenty-seven years of being a comedian.

06:52.620 --> 06:55.288
And in those 27 years,
I never had to worry.

06:55.289 --> 06:59.709
You know, when I first got started,
shoot... 1997,

06:59.710 --> 07:01.421
I was clean-shaven,

07:02.296 --> 07:03.256
I had hair.

07:04.799 --> 07:06.968
I know. Look at some of you.
"What happened?"

07:07.760 --> 07:08.844
Huh?

07:08.845 --> 07:10.388
Vaccine. I know.

07:12.849 --> 07:15.100
I'm kidding. I'm kid...
I'm kidding. Sorry, Florida.

07:15.101 --> 07:17.144
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

07:17.145 --> 07:20.105
I said "Vaccine," some of you were like,
"I told you!" Yeah.

07:21.232 --> 07:23.066
"I told you. He said so."

07:25.278 --> 07:27.070
Some friends tell me,

07:27.071 --> 07:30.740
"Dude, man, you're making money now.
Why don't you get the hair thingy?"

07:30.741 --> 07:31.741
I said, "For what?"

07:31.742 --> 07:34.454
"Well, you know, some women,
they want a guy with hair."

07:34.954 --> 07:36.079
Well, good for them.

07:37.165 --> 07:38.248
And they're not lying.

07:38.249 --> 07:41.418
I have gone out with some women
that made it a point to tell me

07:41.419 --> 07:43.462
that hair was important.

07:43.463 --> 07:48.384
One told me flat out, "I need to be able
to run my fingers through your hair."

07:49.051 --> 07:52.345
Yeah! And I told her,
"Hey, look, if you go deep enough...

07:57.768 --> 07:59.729
...you're gonna get your wish."

08:01.022 --> 08:03.983
"You were not specific on location. Hey."

08:04.609 --> 08:07.028
"You want hair,
you want <i>pelos</i>, I got you."

08:09.363 --> 08:12.866
But, yeah, 27 years of being a comedian.

08:12.867 --> 08:19.206
And in those 27 years,
I have seen a lot of comedians

08:19.207 --> 08:21.958
come and go.

08:21.959 --> 08:25.212
And I feel very grateful
that in all that time,

08:25.213 --> 08:29.633
we've still managed
to maintain a certain level.

08:36.349 --> 08:38.600
So I feel like
we're doing something right.

08:38.601 --> 08:39.935
Which feels weird to me,

08:39.936 --> 08:43.439
because now I feel like
you gotta be very mindful.

08:43.940 --> 08:49.194
Okay? You gotta be extra mindful.
Like... Uh, 27 years of being a comedian,

08:49.195 --> 08:51.780
I finally started hearing
people tell me things

08:51.781 --> 08:53.448
that I've never heard before.

08:53.449 --> 08:55.784
I started hearing people
tell me things like,

08:55.785 --> 09:00.581
"Hey, Fluffy. I grew up watching you."

09:06.546 --> 09:11.675
Which is an incredible compliment
because that doesn't just say

09:11.676 --> 09:13.802
that you're a fan,
that says that you're invested.

09:13.803 --> 09:17.430
That says that you've been following
this career for a very long time.

09:17.431 --> 09:21.519
Some of you, the first time
you saw me perform, you were kids.

09:28.651 --> 09:32.696
And now some of you are here tonight
with your kids.

09:34.156 --> 09:38.243
And so, I just want to say thank you
for all those years of trust

09:38.244 --> 09:40.830
and continuing to come back
to see the show.

09:41.414 --> 09:42.540
It means a lot.

09:47.628 --> 09:50.589
Hearing someone say
they grew up watching me,

09:50.590 --> 09:52.841
that is one of
the most beautiful compliments

09:52.842 --> 09:54.342
any entertainer can receive.

09:54.343 --> 09:58.888
And I understand that now,
with therapy, that that's what that means.

09:58.889 --> 10:01.391
Look, I'm not gonna lie.

10:01.392 --> 10:04.978
The first time I heard someone tell me
that they grew up watching me,

10:04.979 --> 10:07.480
I didn't know how to handle it.

10:07.481 --> 10:09.566
I didn't know how to process

10:09.567 --> 10:15.822
because nobody wants
to feel like they're getting... old.

10:15.823 --> 10:17.657
The first time I heard it, I was like...

10:19.785 --> 10:22.830
Second time I heard it,
I was like, "Buy a hat."

10:23.664 --> 10:26.333
The third time, I accepted it. I was like,

10:26.334 --> 10:30.211
"Many years ago, when I first got started,

10:30.212 --> 10:34.132
all of this was land
as far as the eye could see."

10:34.133 --> 10:36.384
"It was a very different time, and..."

10:36.385 --> 10:39.304
By the way, I don't know
why my old voice is white.

10:41.432 --> 10:42.933
He just is.

10:43.726 --> 10:47.312
I tried doing the Mexican voice,
but you don't take him as serious.

10:47.313 --> 10:48.938
"Well, screw you."

10:48.939 --> 10:52.442
"We were at the ranch,
and were told to fuck off, dude."

10:52.443 --> 10:54.236
"It's very tough out there."

10:57.573 --> 11:00.241
But times are changing.
The rules are changing.

11:00.242 --> 11:02.369
So I don't know
how much longer this is gonna be okay.

11:02.370 --> 11:05.622
I'll tell you what happened to me
and why I brought that up.

11:05.623 --> 11:07.749
I did a podcast.

11:07.750 --> 11:12.629
And before I went into the studio,
I'm talking to the producer outside.

11:12.630 --> 11:16.633
And the producer's excited and happy,
and she's like, "Gabriel Iglesias,

11:16.634 --> 11:18.134
we're so excited to have you."

11:18.135 --> 11:19.511
"This is really cool."

11:19.512 --> 11:23.682
"Before you go in, the host wanted me
to ask you something

11:23.683 --> 11:25.350
before you go in for your interview."

11:25.351 --> 11:26.851
I go, "Sure, go for it."

11:26.852 --> 11:31.148
"Okay. What do you identify as?"

11:38.155 --> 11:41.032
I wasn't sure how to answer that.

11:41.033 --> 11:43.952
I'm 47 years old.
I didn't know what to say.

11:43.953 --> 11:45.954
I was like, "Shit. Hungry, I guess."

11:45.955 --> 11:47.872
I mean...

11:47.873 --> 11:50.667
I'm tired, sleepy, depressed on Tuesdays.

11:50.668 --> 11:52.712
I don't know what you want me to say.

11:54.255 --> 11:55.673
See, here's the thing.

11:56.173 --> 11:59.300
I knew what she was trying to ask me.

11:59.301 --> 12:03.972
I just wasn't trying to get involved
in a conversation about something

12:03.973 --> 12:07.601
that has absolutely nothing to do with me.

12:08.102 --> 12:09.352
This was... Yeah.

12:14.233 --> 12:15.942
I felt like I was being baited

12:15.943 --> 12:18.361
because no matter how
I answered that question,

12:18.362 --> 12:21.573
I was gonna find myself
in an awkward situation.

12:21.574 --> 12:25.368
So you know, because for me,
I was just like, "Let me just be funny."

12:25.369 --> 12:30.123
But nowadays, you can't just
not answer the question

12:30.124 --> 12:32.959
because silence is seen as a problem.

12:32.960 --> 12:36.379
And I'm sorry if me not answering
a certain question

12:36.380 --> 12:37.839
is considered a problem.

12:37.840 --> 12:43.011
I was brought up during a time
where you were constantly told

12:43.012 --> 12:46.932
to mind your business.

12:51.854 --> 12:54.898
That's all I'm trying to do
is stay in my lane.

12:54.899 --> 12:57.525
Another thing we were constantly told was

12:57.526 --> 13:02.906
always respect your elders.

13:08.829 --> 13:11.581
And no matter
what generation you were from,

13:11.582 --> 13:15.418
that was at least the one thing
we could always agree on

13:15.419 --> 13:16.419
until now.

13:16.420 --> 13:20.340
Now older people are seen as a problem.

13:20.341 --> 13:21.466
They are.

13:21.467 --> 13:23.009
You know, and I understand

13:23.010 --> 13:26.596
the youth of today has the technology
in the palm of their hands,

13:26.597 --> 13:30.016
and you can google just about anything,

13:30.017 --> 13:34.229
but you cannot google life experience.

13:34.230 --> 13:35.523
Okay?

13:36.106 --> 13:40.860
You can't. You can't download struggling.
You can't download failure.

13:40.861 --> 13:43.738
You can't download these moments
that help build you up

13:43.739 --> 13:45.740
to make you a better person.

13:45.741 --> 13:47.534
And so again, for me,

13:47.535 --> 13:51.120
I chose to stay in my lane
and just crack jokes

13:51.121 --> 13:53.248
when the girl asked me the question.

13:53.249 --> 13:56.459
She got very upset. She got very offended.

13:56.460 --> 13:58.002
As soon as I cracked the joke,

13:58.003 --> 14:00.463
she was like,
"No, that's not what I mean."

14:00.464 --> 14:02.716
"I mean what are your pronouns?"

14:04.760 --> 14:05.594
"What?"

14:06.762 --> 14:07.971
"What are your pronouns?"

14:07.972 --> 14:10.975
"For example, are you a they or them?"

14:12.726 --> 14:14.227
"A they"?

14:15.771 --> 14:16.981
"Or a them"?

14:25.072 --> 14:26.364
"How fat am I?"

14:28.993 --> 14:31.287
"When did I stop being an it?"

14:32.955 --> 14:35.039
Apparently, I ate myself into a plural.

14:35.040 --> 14:36.249
That's what happened.

14:43.549 --> 14:48.553
What I'm finding is,
even if you have good intentions,

14:48.554 --> 14:50.096
and you're trying to be cool,

14:50.097 --> 14:52.473
you can still find yourself
in a situation.

14:52.474 --> 14:55.394
So, I'll tell you
what else happened to me, m'kay?

14:56.103 --> 14:57.812
I was at a McDonald's.

15:03.360 --> 15:05.486
That's not even the joke, but okay.

15:06.822 --> 15:10.117
All righty. They're like,
"Here, this is gonna be good." No, no!

15:11.952 --> 15:14.204
I was at a McDonald's by my house.

15:14.705 --> 15:18.416
The McDonald's by my house
is actually a twofer.

15:18.417 --> 15:22.670
It's a McDonald's on the corner,
and it's also a gas station.

15:22.671 --> 15:25.757
I got a big SUV.
I knew it was gonna be a minute.

15:25.758 --> 15:29.011
So I said, "Let me go get
some nuggets while I'm here."

15:30.554 --> 15:33.723
I walk into the McDonald's,
and as I'm walking in,

15:33.724 --> 15:35.975
I couldn't help but notice

15:35.976 --> 15:39.270
this homeless family
sitting right outside.

15:39.271 --> 15:42.273
Now, they didn't have a sign.

15:42.274 --> 15:46.277
They did not ask me for money,
but you could just tell.

15:46.278 --> 15:50.949
You could just tell that this poor family
is dealing with life.

15:50.950 --> 15:53.326
So I get inside,
and I said, "You know what?"

15:53.327 --> 15:55.244
"I don't need anything to eat."

15:55.245 --> 15:58.832
"I really don't.
At this point, it's just the habit."

16:09.677 --> 16:11.052
I get to the register, and I say,

16:11.053 --> 16:13.388
"You know what?
Let me order some food for the family."

16:13.389 --> 16:14.764
"They got kids with them."

16:14.765 --> 16:18.851
So I placed an order
and the cashier's like, "Anything else?"

16:18.852 --> 16:22.689
"Actually, yes.
Do you have, um... um, Wet-Naps?"

16:22.690 --> 16:25.566
"Excuse me?"
"You know, Wet-Naps to clean your hands."

16:25.567 --> 16:27.944
"Sir, you're more than welcome
to use the restroom."

16:27.945 --> 16:29.278
"I'll give you the code."

16:29.279 --> 16:30.363
"Here's the thing."

16:30.364 --> 16:33.074
"It's not for me.
It's for the homeless family

16:33.075 --> 16:34.867
that's right outside the door."

16:34.868 --> 16:39.330
"I want to make sure that the little kids
can clean their hands before they eat."

16:39.331 --> 16:42.208
"This food that I just ordered
is for them."

16:42.209 --> 16:43.960
And as we're talking...

16:45.921 --> 16:46.922
Thank you.

16:48.048 --> 16:51.592
As we're talking,
the manager at the McDonald's

16:51.593 --> 16:55.805
is listening in to our conversation.

16:55.806 --> 16:58.558
And she walks over.
And she's all nosy, right?

16:58.559 --> 17:01.352
She's like, "Excuse me.
I couldn't help but overhear."

17:01.353 --> 17:04.857
"Did you just say that this food
is for the family outside?"

17:05.733 --> 17:07.525
"Yeah. I hope that's okay."

17:07.526 --> 17:09.861
"No, it is definitely okay."

17:09.862 --> 17:14.699
"Giving food to people who need food
is definitely okay."

17:14.700 --> 17:18.245
"However, what you just called <i>them</i>

17:19.455 --> 17:21.080
is not okay."

17:24.710 --> 17:26.545
"What did I call them?"

17:27.046 --> 17:28.380
"You said...

17:29.882 --> 17:30.924
homeless."

17:32.509 --> 17:34.636
"'Cause they are! Look. Shit."

17:38.932 --> 17:40.683
"He's lickin' the window!"

17:42.394 --> 17:46.190
"You can't say that word.
It's considered offensive."

17:47.191 --> 17:48.734
"Who complained?"

17:50.194 --> 17:53.529
"Okay, well, if I'm not supposed to say
the word 'homeless' anymore,

17:53.530 --> 17:56.742
what am I supposed to say
instead of the word 'homeless'?"

17:57.743 --> 17:59.619
"The new politically correct term

17:59.620 --> 18:02.538
is actually 'unhoused'

18:02.539 --> 18:07.336
when describing someone
in an unfortunate situation like that."

18:14.051 --> 18:15.302
"You're kidding."

18:15.928 --> 18:19.097
"No, sir. I'm not kidding.
And please lower your voice."

18:19.098 --> 18:21.099
"You want me to lower my voice

18:21.100 --> 18:23.810
when you're saying something
so ridiculous?"

18:23.811 --> 18:25.812
"If you think
it's ridiculous,

18:25.813 --> 18:28.524
then clearly, you are part of the problem,

18:29.024 --> 18:30.566
not the solution."

18:35.197 --> 18:37.990
Oh, Miami. I wanted to get ghetto.

18:43.122 --> 18:46.458
I wanted to get ghetto.

18:47.960 --> 18:50.963
Oh yeah. Oh yeah.
I wanted to go full Hialeah on them.

19:00.097 --> 19:01.849
Love you, Fluffy!

19:02.641 --> 19:04.267
Thank you for coming, Hialeah.

19:06.770 --> 19:09.230
So yeah, I wanted to go off on her,
but I... I...

19:09.231 --> 19:11.065
I wanted to get ghetto, but I couldn't

19:11.066 --> 19:14.652
because that is
the regular McDonald's I go to.

19:15.737 --> 19:18.699
You know what I'm saying?
I'm not trying to get banned.

19:19.199 --> 19:22.536
The next one's far, and gas is a bitch,
so I'm like, "Nah."

19:23.453 --> 19:26.747
So I looked at her, and I said,
"Okay. We're gonna play this game?"

19:26.748 --> 19:28.249
"Let's play this game."

19:28.250 --> 19:29.960
"From now on,

19:30.919 --> 19:32.420
I'm no longer fat."

19:33.881 --> 19:37.633
"According to you,
I am now 'unexercised.'"

19:49.771 --> 19:53.567
I did, bro. She looked at me,
and she's like, "Don't be ridiculous."

19:54.276 --> 19:56.360
And I looked at her, and I was like, "Oh!"

19:56.361 --> 20:01.909
"Oh, well, if you think it's ridiculous,
then clearly you are part of the problem."

20:03.744 --> 20:05.411
"Not the solution."

20:07.080 --> 20:09.457
And I grabbed the food, and I walked out.

20:09.458 --> 20:14.212
Now, second half of the story.
I walk over to the family. M'kay?

20:14.213 --> 20:17.049
And I hand the bags of food to the mom.

20:17.549 --> 20:19.884
And the mom was so nice.

20:19.885 --> 20:24.430
She was just happy that someone
thought of her and her kids.

20:24.431 --> 20:25.890
She got very emotional.

20:25.891 --> 20:28.434
She's like,
"I just want to say thank you."

20:28.435 --> 20:31.646
"You have no idea
what you're doing for us right now."

20:31.647 --> 20:33.439
"This really means a lot."

20:33.440 --> 20:34.357
"Thank you."

20:34.358 --> 20:39.195
And I had to ask the question.

20:51.500 --> 20:52.668
I said,

20:54.086 --> 20:55.337
"Are you okay?"

20:56.463 --> 20:58.215
I know what you thought.

21:01.468 --> 21:03.595
Some of you are like, "Don't do it."

21:04.513 --> 21:06.640
Oh, I did it.
That's why we're here. Watch.

21:07.683 --> 21:09.600
So, I looked, and I said, "Are you okay?"

21:09.601 --> 21:14.021
And she was like, "No, unfortunately.
We're not okay. We're not."

21:14.022 --> 21:16.483
"We've been homeless now for four days."

21:17.234 --> 21:19.277
And I was like, "Um..."

21:25.325 --> 21:26.993
"I don't know if you heard."

21:29.830 --> 21:30.998
"But, uh..."

21:34.626 --> 21:36.252
No, not... I didn't correct her.

21:38.297 --> 21:40.464
I didn't correct her
'cause I'm not a dick.

21:40.465 --> 21:42.009
That's why I didn't correct her.

21:45.304 --> 21:46.637
That's what I mean, you guys.

21:46.638 --> 21:48.848
Even if you have good intentions nowadays,

21:48.849 --> 21:51.017
people can take
what you're saying or doing

21:51.018 --> 21:54.061
and twist it to make you look bad.

21:54.062 --> 21:57.481
There should be no consequences

21:57.482 --> 22:01.110
for being kind, for trying to help,

22:01.111 --> 22:05.782
for wanting to do the right thing,
for caring.

22:09.036 --> 22:11.871
Unfortunately, we're still consumed
by this word called "liability"

22:11.872 --> 22:16.250
that sometimes we forget to be
a little human, and that's unfortunate.

22:16.251 --> 22:18.461
I'm not trying to get
on a soapbox about this.

22:18.462 --> 22:21.422
I'm trying to let you know
some things I've been dealing with,

22:21.423 --> 22:23.758
and I'm just here to report.

22:25.886 --> 22:29.638
The thing with me now is
that after 27 years of being a comedian,

22:29.639 --> 22:32.767
every time I walk out the door,

22:32.768 --> 22:36.062
the light is officially on.

22:36.063 --> 22:39.774
In the sense that every time
I leave my house,

22:39.775 --> 22:43.403
there is a slight chance
I could make the news.

22:45.322 --> 22:46.405
For example,

22:46.406 --> 22:51.285
did Martin talk about how, uh, he fell
off the stage earlier in the show?

22:51.286 --> 22:53.204
-  Yeah.
- Okay. Okay, cool.

22:53.205 --> 22:56.957
Uh, for the home audience, Martin,
he fell a while back. He talked about it.

22:56.958 --> 22:58.084
I know you didn't see it,

22:58.085 --> 23:00.461
'cause your subscription
only covers so much.

23:00.462 --> 23:02.547
Um, yeah.

23:03.256 --> 23:05.633
You can watch the first half on Prime.
I think it's on Prime.

23:05.634 --> 23:09.095
Maybe you can just see it there
then come back and check out the rest.

23:09.096 --> 23:12.765
So, long story short, we were doing a show
in Phoenix, Arizona,

23:12.766 --> 23:16.811
and Martin accidentally fell
off of a stage this high,

23:16.812 --> 23:18.354
and he broke his foot.

23:18.355 --> 23:22.691
Now, the incredible part
about Martin is that he got up,

23:22.692 --> 23:28.239
and on adrenaline, ran around,
got back up on stage, and performed.

23:28.240 --> 23:32.618
And then was taken to the hospital
after he walked off stage.

23:32.619 --> 23:34.246
He is a professional.

23:39.835 --> 23:41.961
Seriously, that is a pro.

23:41.962 --> 23:44.797
Much respect
'cause if it would have been me...

23:46.758 --> 23:48.259
If I would've fallen off stage,

23:48.260 --> 23:51.387
and the staff was like,
"What about the fans?"

23:51.388 --> 23:52.888
"Well, bye, Felicia."

23:55.392 --> 23:57.184
"What do we tell 'em?" "Refund."

24:00.355 --> 24:05.359
But see, the difference is
Martin had to tell you he fell

24:05.360 --> 24:07.612
for you to know he fell.

24:08.113 --> 24:10.281
And by the way, I saw the fall. I saw.

24:10.282 --> 24:13.951
He came out and just kind of tripped over
a cord backstage,

24:13.952 --> 24:16.036
came through the curtain already,
you know.

24:16.037 --> 24:19.040
And then, you know... "Martiiin!"

24:23.420 --> 24:25.171
Women in the front row were like,

24:25.172 --> 24:26.839
"He fell for me."

24:29.759 --> 24:30.801
I'm glad you laughed.

24:30.802 --> 24:33.888
I said that last night
and some guy was like, "Aw."

24:35.056 --> 24:36.432
I said, "Why 'aww'?"

24:36.433 --> 24:38.559
"Well, that's your friend."

24:38.560 --> 24:41.855
"Exactly.
That's why I make fun of him."

24:42.939 --> 24:47.401
That is the mark of a true friendship,
is being able to say

24:47.402 --> 24:50.529
real evil things about each other.

24:53.116 --> 24:55.785
Because you know you don't really mean it.

24:56.745 --> 25:00.039
Plus, you don't think
that if I would've fallen off the stage

25:00.040 --> 25:03.210
instead of Martin
that he wouldn't've had a joke?

25:03.877 --> 25:05.836
You better believe
he would have had a joke.

25:05.837 --> 25:08.964
He would have told people,
"I saw Fluffy bounce."

25:11.968 --> 25:14.637
Not to mention the fact
that you know that'll make the news.

25:14.638 --> 25:19.267
I fall off the stage tonight,
there'll be a van out in front in an hour.

25:19.768 --> 25:23.729
"We're standing here live in front
of the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino,

25:23.730 --> 25:27.067
where authorities believe
Fluffy lost control."

25:28.735 --> 25:32.238
"Let's go to Tom, who's inside the venue
who can fill us in with more."

25:32.239 --> 25:37.076
"That's right, Jim, I'm standing here
at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino,

25:37.077 --> 25:41.122
inside the venue
where apparently Fluffy took a spill."

25:42.958 --> 25:45.626
"It is still uncertain
as to what happened here tonight."

25:45.627 --> 25:49.922
"We did have a chance to interview
local authorities who had this to say."

25:49.923 --> 25:51.340
"Damn!"

25:53.927 --> 25:57.096
"It is still uncertain if there
was any problems with the stage."

25:57.097 --> 26:00.349
"We did speak to security
who had this to comment."

26:00.350 --> 26:03.144
"I saw the whole damn thing. Okay?"

26:04.187 --> 26:08.525
"Whoo! Fluffy fell. He fell hard."

26:09.150 --> 26:12.444
"I ain't seen that many white people cry
since a Taylor Swift concert."

26:12.445 --> 26:17.366
"It was bad. It was bad.
And in Miami. Are you kidding me?"

26:17.367 --> 26:20.035
"He hurt more Cubans than Castro."

26:27.919 --> 26:29.253
And that's how you get canceled.

26:29.254 --> 26:32.632
So, uh, that's the point
I'm trying to make here.

26:34.217 --> 26:37.094
I made the news recently.

26:37.095 --> 26:38.971
Uh, without giving too much away,

26:38.972 --> 26:41.765
there's an episode of <i>Family Feud</i>
coming out very soon

26:41.766 --> 26:43.226
that I'm gonna be on.

26:43.768 --> 26:44.768
Yeah.

26:46.646 --> 26:51.358
It is the celebrity edition,
so it's Fluffy and Fluffy's family

26:51.359 --> 26:53.986
versus Fat Joe...

26:55.363 --> 26:56.572
...and his family.

26:56.573 --> 26:58.991
So yeah, it's Fat Joe versus Fluffy

26:58.992 --> 27:02.703
because apparently, the producers
have a great sense of humor.

27:04.205 --> 27:07.041
Long story short, I flew in
some family from the East Coast

27:07.042 --> 27:08.208
to be on the show.

27:08.209 --> 27:11.545
The show went over very well.
You'll find out who wins later.

27:11.546 --> 27:12.463
Here's the deal.

27:12.464 --> 27:16.467
The next day, my sister,
who was one of the people I flew in,

27:16.468 --> 27:18.719
she hadn't been in California in forever,

27:18.720 --> 27:21.180
and she was like,
"Can we go to Disneyland?"

27:21.181 --> 27:23.557
And I'm like, "Sure, let's go."

27:23.558 --> 27:26.769
So it was her and her husband Gordy,
and I took them to Disney.

27:26.770 --> 27:30.147
And we get on a couple of rides,
and just so we're clear,

27:30.148 --> 27:32.066
that's not what made the news.

27:33.693 --> 27:36.362
I said that last night,
someone was like, "'Cause he fit."

27:36.363 --> 27:37.613
No!

27:38.948 --> 27:40.617
Some people. Right? Yeah.

27:43.411 --> 27:47.665
We get on the <i>Cars</i> ride
at California Adventure,

27:47.666 --> 27:50.459
and halfway through the <i>Cars</i> ride,
the car...

27:52.796 --> 27:54.755
...stops on the track.

27:54.756 --> 27:56.131
And my sister looked at me.

27:56.132 --> 27:58.551
She goes, "Is this supposed to happen?"

27:59.219 --> 28:02.555
I go, "No, the check cleared.
We're supposed to finish. This is, uh..."

28:03.390 --> 28:05.767
"We paid. It's supposed to work.
No, this..."

28:06.768 --> 28:10.187
It took the Disney people
about 20 minutes to come get us

28:10.188 --> 28:11.772
and take us out of the car.

28:11.773 --> 28:16.111
So we're sitting there,
outside, in the sun for 20 minutes.

28:16.903 --> 28:21.282
I had no problem
with that because I am mocha.

28:23.118 --> 28:25.452
I'm okay in the sun for 20 minutes.

28:25.453 --> 28:28.330
My sister, she's twice as dark as me.

28:28.331 --> 28:31.835
She's, like, freaking, you know, Apache.
She's... You know.

28:32.460 --> 28:33.419
Freaking <i>Azteca.</i>

28:33.420 --> 28:35.171
Just, you know...

28:36.339 --> 28:39.717
Her husband, on the other hand,
he's from Minnesota.

28:44.347 --> 28:45.556
He almost died.

28:47.183 --> 28:51.770
"Oh, don' cha know?" Yeah, so...
while we're sitting there in the car,

28:51.771 --> 28:55.232
waiting for the Disney people
to come take us out of the car,

28:55.233 --> 29:00.112
the people waiting in line
realize that the ride has been shut down.

29:00.113 --> 29:04.283
And so from the ride,
you can see the line.

29:04.284 --> 29:06.536
People see the car on the track,

29:07.203 --> 29:08.371
and then they see

29:08.955 --> 29:10.706
who's in the car.

29:11.750 --> 29:14.793
And all of a sudden,
cell phones start comin' out.

29:14.794 --> 29:17.004
And by the time we left Disney,

29:17.005 --> 29:21.341
TMZ had already reported the story,
and you can google this, okay?

29:21.342 --> 29:22.885
TMZ reported the story.

29:22.886 --> 29:24.094
Before we left the park,

29:24.095 --> 29:28.390
it said, "Fluffy Stuck
on LA Freeway at Disney."

29:31.352 --> 29:32.603
I thought it was cute.

29:32.604 --> 29:33.896
I thought it was silly.

29:33.897 --> 29:36.691
I thought it was funny.
I thought it was okay.

29:37.317 --> 29:39.193
Until I read the comments.

29:40.862 --> 29:43.490
Oh, some of you...

29:45.492 --> 29:46.825
are dicks.

29:52.540 --> 29:55.334
One lady wrote, "Just 'cause
you're tall enough to ride

29:55.335 --> 29:57.629
doesn't mean you're small enough to fit."

30:00.340 --> 30:03.258
A guy wrote, "The car got tired."

30:04.969 --> 30:08.013
Another guy wrote,
"You're Mexican. Couldn't you fix it?"

30:11.976 --> 30:14.019
And that was Martin, yeah. So...

30:15.772 --> 30:17.524
Anyway, so...

30:20.735 --> 30:24.571
The time before that, we made world news.

30:24.572 --> 30:26.615
Some of you might remember this story.

30:26.616 --> 30:31.370
The guys and I were involved
in an emergency landing situation.

30:31.371 --> 30:34.498
I had, uh, chartered a private jet

30:34.499 --> 30:39.002
because my last Netflix special,
the money finally hit my account,

30:39.003 --> 30:43.842
and I, you know, freakin'...
I thought I was, y'know, ballin', right?

30:44.801 --> 30:46.928
Nope. Turns out we were fallin'!

30:49.722 --> 30:55.727
Worst turbulence we have ever experienced
in 27 years of being comedians.

30:55.728 --> 30:58.438
Uh, worst turbulence I ever felt,
for sure.

30:58.439 --> 31:00.899
At one point, the jet did this.

31:02.735 --> 31:04.278
I did this.

31:07.156 --> 31:11.369
The scariest part was
watching my dogs leave the seat.

31:13.246 --> 31:15.831
Fortunately, we landed safely.
We were okay.

31:15.832 --> 31:18.000
That's not what made the news.

31:18.001 --> 31:21.504
What made the news is that,
when we came in for the landing,

31:22.755 --> 31:26.175
the jet touched down,
and then it skid off the runway

31:26.676 --> 31:30.638
by 200 yards, and we ended up in a field.

31:31.806 --> 31:32.974
A field.

31:34.434 --> 31:35.351
A field!

31:36.936 --> 31:38.270
Are you kidding me?

31:38.271 --> 31:41.732
As hard as I work...

31:52.660 --> 31:54.536
...to break stereotypes.

31:57.040 --> 32:00.208
A bunch of Mexicans ended up in a field.
Yeah, that's what happened.

32:01.961 --> 32:05.422
That's how TMZ reported it.
"Mexicans Found in Field."

32:07.800 --> 32:11.512
In the movies,
the pilots are always the first to know

32:12.096 --> 32:13.347
when there's an issue.

32:13.348 --> 32:18.477
And in the movies,
the pilots always have the courtesy

32:18.478 --> 32:20.896
of telling the passengers.

32:20.897 --> 32:23.941
They love to hear themselves talk.
They get on the mic,

32:23.942 --> 32:25.776
"All right.
It's your captain speaking here."

32:25.777 --> 32:28.654
"I just want to let you know
we'll be experiencing rough air."

32:28.655 --> 32:33.033
"If you could just fasten your seatbelts,
we're gonna be A-okay. All right..."

32:34.535 --> 32:36.578
You know? If it gets bumpy, you know,

32:39.040 --> 32:40.582
"It's your captain speaking."

32:40.583 --> 32:43.001
"Somebody just had
a little Mexican food here,

32:43.002 --> 32:46.129
so we... we're feeling
a little bumpy up here."

32:46.130 --> 32:47.881
"We just had some fast food."

32:47.882 --> 32:50.467
"Just a reminder
to keep your seat belts fastened."

32:50.468 --> 32:53.303
"We might be getting a bit...
There we go. Just a bit there."

32:53.304 --> 32:56.056
"All right, I'll be back with you
in just a few seconds..."

32:58.059 --> 33:00.477
If the plane's going down,
"Brace for impact!"

33:00.478 --> 33:02.981
"Hold on tight! We're comin' in hot!"

33:03.940 --> 33:04.774
Our pilot...

33:05.525 --> 33:06.441
<i>nada</i>.

33:08.486 --> 33:12.489
Our pilot didn't say anything
until we came to, like, a complete stop.

33:12.490 --> 33:14.199
And then maybe like a minute later,

33:14.200 --> 33:17.077
the cockpit door opened up,
and he stuck his head in,

33:17.078 --> 33:18.870
and he's like, "You good?"

33:25.086 --> 33:26.337
I was like,

33:27.839 --> 33:30.675
"My chihuahua's in a cup holder.
I am not good."

33:33.970 --> 33:36.471
It was a scary situation, you guys,

33:36.472 --> 33:41.935
but let me tell you, even though
we were involved in an emergency landing

33:41.936 --> 33:43.812
and we thought we were gonna die,

33:43.813 --> 33:47.441
I'm grateful for the experience.

33:47.442 --> 33:48.734
Believe it or not.

33:48.735 --> 33:54.240
I'm grateful because it reminded me
how valuable life is

33:55.158 --> 33:57.452
and how quickly things can change.

34:00.747 --> 34:03.165
Every now and then,
we need a little reminder.

34:03.166 --> 34:05.834
We need to get shaken up a little
to remind ourselves,

34:05.835 --> 34:07.294
"Oh my God. This is special."

34:07.295 --> 34:10.047
"This is important. Enjoy it. Have fun."

34:10.048 --> 34:15.385
The rest of the day after the landing,
there was nothing anybody could tell me

34:15.386 --> 34:19.723
to ruin how good I felt
to just be breathing and be alive.

34:19.724 --> 34:21.099
Nothing!

34:27.106 --> 34:32.069
And so, that's why I, uh...
I'm grateful for bad moments.

34:32.070 --> 34:35.655
And I think bad moments
are actually a good thing

34:35.656 --> 34:37.365
because we need balance in life.

34:37.366 --> 34:39.826
You need to have bad experiences

34:39.827 --> 34:43.955
in order to truly appreciate
good experiences.

34:43.956 --> 34:45.832
Not every day can be the same.

34:47.043 --> 34:49.169
You need to have a way to ba--

34:49.170 --> 34:50.921
Now, don't get me wrong.

34:50.922 --> 34:53.841
Sometimes there's too many bad days
in a row. That shit sucks.

34:54.759 --> 34:56.635
And that's actually what happened to me.

34:56.636 --> 35:00.263
After the near-death experience,
I go home.

35:00.264 --> 35:04.601
I go home to find out
that someone broke into my house.

35:05.770 --> 35:08.480
Yeah. Yeah, I'm like,
"Are you kidding me?"

35:08.481 --> 35:10.690
"That's why I survived? To see this shit?"

35:11.901 --> 35:14.820
The only reason why
you haven't heard about it until now

35:14.821 --> 35:17.322
is because the detective
who's working the case

35:17.323 --> 35:20.118
told me I'm not allowed to talk about it.

35:22.411 --> 35:23.787
In California.

35:26.666 --> 35:30.586
Yeah, if the guys that broke into my house
are here tonight... [scoffs] ...bravo.

35:31.796 --> 35:34.173
Bravo.
That's a flex and a half.

35:35.049 --> 35:38.760
No, they broke into my house,
and of course, the number one question is,

35:38.761 --> 35:40.804
"What did they take from your house?"

35:40.805 --> 35:43.849
And what they took from me,
honestly, it was my peace of mind.

35:43.850 --> 35:46.685
I didn't feel safe in that house after.

35:46.686 --> 35:48.520
Uh, but if you must know,

35:48.521 --> 35:51.148
I did everything to prevent a break-in.

35:51.149 --> 35:54.484
I had, first of all, a good neighborhood.

35:54.485 --> 35:58.155
I had an alarm. I had two camera systems.

35:58.156 --> 36:00.240
I had a fence
that surrounded the property.

36:00.241 --> 36:01.617
I thought I was good.

36:02.410 --> 36:06.372
Um, I got video footage
of the entire robbery.

36:10.459 --> 36:11.502
In 4K.

36:14.005 --> 36:15.548
Oh, that shit is crisp.

36:16.799 --> 36:20.552
I saw the guys that broke in,
but I could not identify them

36:20.553 --> 36:22.554
because they were wearing masks.

36:22.555 --> 36:25.515
All I can tell you about the two guys
that broke into my house

36:25.516 --> 36:29.227
is that they were 20 years old.

36:29.228 --> 36:30.687
I know they were 20

36:30.688 --> 36:33.858
because when they jumped the fence
and hit the ground,

36:34.525 --> 36:35.734
no pain.

36:37.862 --> 36:40.655
If that would've been
a 35-year-old with messed-up sciatica,

36:40.656 --> 36:42.783
he'd have thought twice about that fence.

36:44.160 --> 36:46.703
So, they jumped the fence,
went in the backyard,

36:46.704 --> 36:49.706
and they broke the window
and got in through the kitchen.

36:49.707 --> 36:52.459
They trashed my house.

36:52.460 --> 36:55.045
Okay, every drawer, open.
Every cabinet, open.

36:55.046 --> 36:58.924
Everything got pulled out onto the floor
so they could sift. Uh...

36:58.925 --> 37:01.551
Couches were flipped over,
cushions were thrown down,

37:01.552 --> 37:05.556
and they pulled
every single frame off the wall.

37:06.182 --> 37:10.060
And I asked the detective, I said,
"Hey, look. I understand the drawers,

37:10.061 --> 37:12.812
the cabinets, and even the couch thing."

37:12.813 --> 37:15.565
"But what's the story
with the frames on the wall?"

37:15.566 --> 37:19.152
"Why did they take everything
off the wall but didn't take any frames?"

37:19.153 --> 37:21.072
"Some of that stuff was art."

37:21.656 --> 37:24.366
"Mr. Iglesias,
you have to understand something

37:24.367 --> 37:27.077
about these people
that broke into your home."

37:27.078 --> 37:30.872
"They were not looking for photos or art."

37:30.873 --> 37:34.167
"They were actually looking for a safe."

37:34.168 --> 37:36.795
I said, "A safe?"
"Yes, sir. A safe."

37:36.796 --> 37:40.215
"A lot of times, in these homes,
people will put a hole in the wall,

37:40.216 --> 37:44.052
install a safe,
and then they'll hang a frame

37:44.053 --> 37:47.973
over the safe to disguise
that their valuables are in there."

37:47.974 --> 37:49.224
I said, "A safe?"

37:49.225 --> 37:52.103
"Sir, yes, a safe."

37:52.853 --> 37:54.896
"But I just got this money."

37:57.441 --> 37:59.693
"Did they check the mattress?"

38:01.362 --> 38:03.572
"Don't know."
"Let's find out!"

38:04.573 --> 38:08.368
So, we walk into the master bedroom.
I grab the edge of the bed, right?

38:08.369 --> 38:10.578
And I picked it up, and I was like,

38:10.579 --> 38:12.414
"Ah, stupid!"

38:20.756 --> 38:22.091
"It's all here."

38:23.426 --> 38:25.510
Oh my God. These guys had no idea

38:25.511 --> 38:27.846
they were robbing somebody
more ghetto than them.

38:31.726 --> 38:33.893
So, at the end of it, they only got

38:33.894 --> 38:36.646
a couple of little trinkets
from the drawers.

38:36.647 --> 38:39.149
Um, and that's pretty much it.

38:39.150 --> 38:40.734
They made a mess of the house.

38:40.735 --> 38:42.861
They didn't get any of the money.

38:42.862 --> 38:45.238
I'll tell you what they <i>did</i> get.

38:45.239 --> 38:46.781
They got my guns.

38:48.868 --> 38:50.536
Now...

38:51.037 --> 38:55.290
I have never been open about the fact

38:55.291 --> 39:01.004
that I am, in fact,
a registered gun owner.

39:07.845 --> 39:09.637
Relax, Florida.

39:13.934 --> 39:16.936
I've never been open about it
because, quite frankly,

39:16.937 --> 39:18.939
it's nobody's business.

39:19.440 --> 39:20.399
Okay?

39:21.192 --> 39:25.528
However, it does pertain to the story
that I'm about to share with you.

39:25.529 --> 39:29.366
Um, I am a recent gun owner.

39:29.367 --> 39:32.994
I became a gun owner in 2020, m'kay?

39:32.995 --> 39:35.288
Uh, yeah, when we were in the middle of...

39:35.289 --> 39:36.414
...it.

39:37.833 --> 39:41.211
Every morning watching the news,
we didn't know what was gonna happen,

39:41.212 --> 39:45.298
and it started to feel irresponsible,

39:45.299 --> 39:50.345
not preparing myself
for a worst-case situation.

39:50.346 --> 39:52.472
Every morning watching the news,

39:52.473 --> 39:55.600
it felt like we were headed
towards the Purge.

39:57.728 --> 40:00.021
Some of you are laughing,
but think about this,

40:00.022 --> 40:02.690
the Purge would have taken less time.

40:05.069 --> 40:06.444
Yeah, the Purge.

40:06.445 --> 40:10.574
That's how they should've woke us up,
at least for entertainment purposes.

40:18.165 --> 40:21.334
"I'd like to thank you
for your participation in the pandemic."

40:21.335 --> 40:25.214
"The local time is 7:45 a.m."

40:34.056 --> 40:37.725
Fear is why I decided to buy a gun.

40:37.726 --> 40:40.311
I was afraid,
and I got no problem saying that.

40:40.312 --> 40:41.271
I was scared.

40:41.272 --> 40:43.231
We didn't know what was gonna happen.

40:43.232 --> 40:45.775
Um, it's only for protection.

40:45.776 --> 40:48.028
I don't hunt.

40:48.529 --> 40:52.282
I don't want to hunt. I don't need to.
I know where there's three Chick-fil-As.

40:53.868 --> 40:54.827
I'm good.

40:55.661 --> 40:57.328
I don't go out on the weekends, you know?

40:57.329 --> 40:59.456
Pull!

40:59.457 --> 41:00.665
There's no...

41:02.168 --> 41:04.628
I still own a Nintendo.
I don't need that shit.

41:06.505 --> 41:10.258
Fear is the only reason
why I decided to buy a gun.

41:10.259 --> 41:12.760
So, I wound up
at this sporting goods store

41:12.761 --> 41:14.012
right by my house.

41:14.013 --> 41:18.349
I walk in there, and this place
is packed full of people

41:18.350 --> 41:23.480
that normally would not have been open
to the idea of owning a gun,

41:23.481 --> 41:24.689
but they felt like me.

41:24.690 --> 41:26.691
They were scared, and rightfully so.

41:26.692 --> 41:30.278
I kept hearing the same conversation
over and over and over.

41:30.279 --> 41:31.946
I kept hearing this...

41:31.947 --> 41:36.367
"I would rather have a gun and not need it

41:36.368 --> 41:40.955
than need it and not have it."

41:45.753 --> 41:51.758
And I don't care where you're from,
that makes a lot of sense.

41:51.759 --> 41:58.014
And I was not about to let politics
interfere with my personal safety.

41:58.015 --> 41:59.557
So, next thing you know...

42:01.936 --> 42:05.480
So, next thing you know, I got in line.
I had to get a ticket with a number

42:05.481 --> 42:07.815
like when you're at the DMV
or meat market.

42:07.816 --> 42:09.068
The butcher shop.

42:10.110 --> 42:12.821
The bodega. "Number five!"

42:14.448 --> 42:15.823
I got in line.

42:15.824 --> 42:19.119
Forty-five minutes, I waited in line.

42:20.246 --> 42:22.997
And as soon as I get to the front,
this guy comes to the counter,

42:22.998 --> 42:25.834
and he's like...
"How can I help you, son?"

42:26.919 --> 42:28.253
"Well, um..."

42:28.254 --> 42:32.215
By the way, I heard some of you chuckle,
and just so we're clear,

42:32.216 --> 42:37.137
I'm not saying that... all people

42:38.722 --> 42:40.723
...who sell guns...

42:44.937 --> 42:46.145
...talk like that.

42:49.275 --> 42:50.358
But his name was Jim.

42:52.945 --> 42:55.698
So, Jim was like,
"How can I help you, son?"

42:56.323 --> 42:59.742
"Well, I'm here to see about purchasing
my first firearm."

42:59.743 --> 43:02.203
"Well, you've come to the right place.
Know what you want?"

43:02.204 --> 43:03.371
"Or you need a hand?"

43:03.372 --> 43:06.082
"I've had some time
to look at your selection,

43:06.083 --> 43:08.543
and I think I found something
that's gonna work for me."

43:08.544 --> 43:10.420
"All right.
Show me what you got."

43:10.421 --> 43:13.631
"Okay, right over here in the case."
"This one?" "Yeah, right here."

43:13.632 --> 43:15.717
"This one.
The one right here, in the front."

43:15.718 --> 43:17.594
"This one?" "No. Not that one. This one."

43:17.595 --> 43:21.306
"This one?" "No. This one. Not that one."
"This one?" "No. The one in front."

43:21.307 --> 43:24.934
"With the tag. The tag. Right here.
The one that says two-two."

43:32.985 --> 43:36.113
"Um, sir,
did you just call that gun...

43:39.033 --> 43:40.241
a 'tutu'?"

43:44.872 --> 43:46.874
"Yeah. What?"

43:47.374 --> 43:49.584
"Ji... Jim, right? Jim? Jim."

43:49.585 --> 43:52.170
"Don't look at me like I'm crazy, dude.
I'm just reading the tag."

43:52.171 --> 43:55.341
"It says it right here.
In the front. It says two-two."

43:57.051 --> 43:58.969
"You mean a .22?"

44:00.721 --> 44:04.558
"Well, yeah.
I guess. Two-two, .22, same thing."

44:05.059 --> 44:07.935
"Son, I hate to break it to you,
but there's a big difference

44:07.936 --> 44:11.523
between a tutu and a .22."

44:12.149 --> 44:15.485
"But hey, this is California,
so whatever floats your boat, son."

44:15.486 --> 44:16.402
"All right?"

44:18.238 --> 44:23.910
"Now, is there any particular reason
why you have selected a, uh... a 'tutu'?"

44:26.246 --> 44:30.333
"Well, um, as impressive
as your selection of guns here is,

44:30.334 --> 44:32.752
I recognize a lot of them from movies."

44:32.753 --> 44:34.170
"It's a bit much for me."

44:34.171 --> 44:35.463
"Um, I'm very simple."

44:35.464 --> 44:37.965
"Um, this gun looks very manageable."

44:37.966 --> 44:40.843
"It's small and, you know, it looks easy."

44:40.844 --> 44:42.429
"Plus, it's on sale."

44:43.430 --> 44:46.392
"You know what I mean?
Come on, man. A gun's a gun, right?"

44:52.106 --> 44:53.273
"Not exactly."

44:54.316 --> 44:56.526
"Is this not a good choice?"

44:56.527 --> 45:00.530
"Son, you want my opinion,
or you want to buy and be done with it?"

45:00.531 --> 45:02.907
"No, please tell me
if I'm making a mistake."

45:02.908 --> 45:08.413
"Is... is a... a .22 a good gun or a bad gun?"

45:08.414 --> 45:11.791
"Son, in my personal opinion,
you're better off tickling him,

45:11.792 --> 45:13.418
as far as I'm concerned."

45:14.753 --> 45:17.798
"All you're gonna do is aggravate
the situation."

45:19.591 --> 45:22.720
"You're just gonna piss him off
is what I'm trying to tell you."

45:24.054 --> 45:26.139
"Well,
listen to my thought process."

45:26.140 --> 45:29.100
"My whole idea for the gun is,
I'm gonna use the gun

45:29.101 --> 45:31.060
more so like as a deterrent."

45:31.061 --> 45:35.565
"So if somebody breaks into the house,
they're gonna see this big bald Mexican

45:35.566 --> 45:38.276
holding a gun,
and then they're gonna think twice

45:38.277 --> 45:40.487
and then rob my neighbors instead."

45:41.739 --> 45:44.907
"Son, if somebody breaks
into your house and they have a gun,

45:44.908 --> 45:46.868
they're gonna know you're holding a .22."

45:46.869 --> 45:50.663
"And I'll tell you what's gon' happen.
They're gon' take it from ya."

45:52.166 --> 45:55.085
"And they're gonna beat
the holy hell outta you with it. Right?"

45:56.003 --> 45:58.087
"And the beating
you're gon' get from a .22

45:58.088 --> 46:01.507
is gonna hurt a hell of a lot more
than the bullets out of a .22."

46:01.508 --> 46:02.967
"That's for damn sure."

46:06.221 --> 46:11.726
"Now, listen, I don't know you,
but I think I know your situation."

46:11.727 --> 46:13.269
"And correct me if I'm wrong."

46:13.270 --> 46:16.147
"You want to protect your home?"
"Yes."

46:16.148 --> 46:17.565
"Your family?"

46:17.566 --> 46:20.234
"Yes."
"Your valuables?"

46:20.235 --> 46:22.321
"Yes."
"All right, follow me."

46:22.821 --> 46:24.655
"I think I got just what you need
right here."

46:24.656 --> 46:25.782
"M'kay?"

46:25.783 --> 46:30.578
"You see this right here?
This here's a 9 millimeter to start."

46:30.579 --> 46:32.289
"Okay?"

46:32.998 --> 46:35.958
"A 9 millimeter is a solid firearm."

46:35.959 --> 46:39.796
"Two to the chest,
that man is going down, ten out of ten."

46:41.965 --> 46:46.720
"However, I got this special
military-grade ammunition over here."

46:48.138 --> 46:49.848
"I got this here bullet."

46:50.432 --> 46:51.850
"It's called a spreader."

46:52.893 --> 46:55.269
"Yeah, it's what I used to call my ex."

46:57.189 --> 46:59.482
"She was a real pistol too,
let me tell you."

46:59.483 --> 47:02.443
"That's why I had to move to California.
She'll never find me here."

47:02.444 --> 47:05.822
"So, this bullet,
when it comes out the chamber,

47:05.823 --> 47:06.949
it opens up."

47:07.449 --> 47:13.497
"And when it hits,
it'll leave a hole about yay big."

47:14.289 --> 47:17.583
And stupid me, I said this, I said,

47:17.584 --> 47:19.001
"People survive that?"

47:21.964 --> 47:23.257
"Survive?"

47:24.299 --> 47:25.634
"Survive?"

47:26.552 --> 47:28.302
"Son, you don't want 'em to survive."

47:28.303 --> 47:31.722
"You want 'em dead as fried chicken,
as far as I'm concerned."

47:34.601 --> 47:37.437
I said, "I don't want anybody to die."

47:38.313 --> 47:40.524
"You don't want anybody to die?!"

47:41.024 --> 47:42.483
"You guys hear that?"

47:42.484 --> 47:45.903
"You hear that?
He don't want anybody to die!"

47:45.904 --> 47:48.948
"Yeah! Oh yeah,
you know who he voted for."

47:55.622 --> 47:58.750
"Look here, Tutu,
you're stressin' me the hell out, man."

47:59.501 --> 48:03.046
"I wanna help you, but you gotta want
to help yourself, so listen."

48:04.339 --> 48:07.342
"I'mma do everything in my power
to get through this. Um..."

48:09.678 --> 48:11.930
"I'mma paint a picture for you, m'kay?"

48:12.431 --> 48:13.849
"You're home."

48:14.349 --> 48:16.602
"Someone breaks into your home."

48:17.644 --> 48:18.645
"They have a gun."

48:19.229 --> 48:20.230
"You have a gun."

48:20.731 --> 48:25.109
"You have already told this person
to leave or you will shoot,

48:25.110 --> 48:26.861
and they're not leavin'."

48:26.862 --> 48:29.030
"Matter of fact,
they're doing the opposite."

48:29.031 --> 48:32.283
"They're getting closer
and closer and closer and closer."

48:32.284 --> 48:35.161
"Now they're so close,
you can see the whites of their eyes."

48:35.162 --> 48:38.039
"This individual is standing directly
in front of you."

48:38.040 --> 48:39.625
"You can see each other."

48:40.125 --> 48:43.961
"This individual is prepared to do
whatever it takes

48:43.962 --> 48:49.216
to leave with whatever they want,
including taking your life."

48:49.217 --> 48:53.095
"My question to you is,
are you prepared to do the same?"

48:53.096 --> 48:56.474
"Are you willing to protect your family,
your home, your valuables,

48:56.475 --> 48:59.769
and most importantly,
yourself, in this situation?"

48:59.770 --> 49:01.437
"What are you gonna do?"

49:05.651 --> 49:07.151
"First of all, bro."

49:09.404 --> 49:11.948
"You should sell,
like, life insurance, man, 'cause..."

49:12.991 --> 49:15.994
"You're missing your calling.
I felt that. I felt it."

49:16.745 --> 49:17.871
Um...

49:19.081 --> 49:23.709
"If I'm cornered like that,
and I have absolutely no choice,

49:23.710 --> 49:25.753
and my life is in danger,

49:25.754 --> 49:29.715
I promise you, Jim, I will step up, man,
and I will shoot them right in the leg."

49:29.716 --> 49:30.633
"I will."

49:36.223 --> 49:40.769
"You think you're gonna hit
the leg, Mr. First-Time Gun Owner?"

49:41.603 --> 49:44.105
"Hey, if I buy that bullet
you're trying to sell me,

49:44.106 --> 49:47.317
that covers that much,
up close, I can hit a leg."

49:48.694 --> 49:51.738
"Two steps closer, I'll shoot him
in the <i>huevos</i>. I will, dude."

49:52.239 --> 49:55.241
"I'll hit a <i>pelota</i>.
I will. No more babies, man."

49:55.242 --> 49:58.954
"All right. All right.
You don't gotta get graphic on me, now."

50:00.038 --> 50:02.915
"Son, you know what's gonna happen
if you shoot someone in your home,

50:02.916 --> 50:06.168
in the leg, and they live?"

50:06.169 --> 50:07.545
"Yeah. I know."

50:07.546 --> 50:11.090
"I'm gonna sleep better,
knowing I didn't take a life

50:11.091 --> 50:14.719
and I was able to protect my home,
my family, and my stuff."

50:14.720 --> 50:16.388
"That's what's gonna happen."

50:17.681 --> 50:18.724
Ah.

50:19.850 --> 50:22.268
"Clearly, you're a Disney fan."

50:25.147 --> 50:28.817
"That's about the biggest fantasy
I've ever heard, right there."

50:29.443 --> 50:32.236
"Son, I would ask you
if you knew, but clearly, you don't,

50:32.237 --> 50:35.031
so I'm not gonna waste my time
spinnin' my wheels on this one."

50:35.032 --> 50:37.450
"I'm just gonna call it like it is."

50:37.451 --> 50:42.663
"If you shoot someone
in your home and they live,

50:42.664 --> 50:47.919
they can come back and sue your ass."

50:48.670 --> 50:50.839
"That's right. Now, here's the kicker."

50:51.423 --> 50:52.841
"They're gonna win."

50:53.633 --> 50:55.594
"That's right. They're gonna win."

50:56.344 --> 50:59.221
"And not only are they gonna get
everything they wanted to get

50:59.222 --> 51:03.309
when they first broke in,
when it's all said and done,

51:03.310 --> 51:08.439
you are gonna cut them a big fat check."

51:08.440 --> 51:11.068
"Now, what do you got to say about that?"

51:11.651 --> 51:13.611
I said, "That motherfucker's gonna die!"

51:24.039 --> 51:24.997
He got excited.

51:24.998 --> 51:26.666
"Now, we're talkin'!"

51:28.293 --> 51:30.044
I found out something that day.

51:30.045 --> 51:35.300
I found out that people that sell guns
are a lot like people that sell used cars.

51:36.259 --> 51:40.096
They play on your emotions,
and then they start to upsell you

51:40.097 --> 51:43.266
and make you buy things
you don't want or need.

51:43.850 --> 51:47.561
He knew I was scared
because he kept saying it to me.

51:47.562 --> 51:49.021
"I know you're scared."

51:49.022 --> 51:52.441
"You're scared, and your fears.
You're worried. You're scared."

51:52.442 --> 51:55.778
Every time he'd say "scared,"
something else appeared on the counter.

51:57.656 --> 52:03.369
He sold me so well
that when he was done "selling me,"

52:03.370 --> 52:06.038
I wound up with four rifles...

52:07.457 --> 52:10.043
...and four handguns

52:10.836 --> 52:15.381
and a case... a case of spreader ammunition.

52:17.384 --> 52:19.761
I hear some of you clapping, and why?

52:20.929 --> 52:22.596
It's excessive.

52:22.597 --> 52:24.348
I only have two hands.

52:26.434 --> 52:31.647
See, I feel, again,
even though my home was burglarized,

52:31.648 --> 52:37.319
I feel grateful because I wasn't there
and I had my dogs with me.

52:37.320 --> 52:40.781
I can't replace my dogs.
I can't replace me.

52:42.450 --> 52:43.702
Stuff is stuff.

52:45.620 --> 52:50.583
However, if I would have been home,
I would have done whatever I needed to do.

52:50.584 --> 52:53.961
That's the difference. In this situation,
there's two kinds of people.

52:53.962 --> 52:58.382
One, people like me, had the guns,
had the ammo, glad they weren't there,

52:58.383 --> 53:01.886
but if they were there,
they would've done something about it.

53:01.887 --> 53:03.554
'Cause if I was in bed and I heard the...

53:04.806 --> 53:07.141
...I would've jumped up.

53:07.142 --> 53:09.560
I would've grabbed my gun.

53:09.561 --> 53:13.355
I would've ran out into the living room
with no shirt on and one sock off.

53:14.733 --> 53:16.650
I'd have confronted the person.

53:16.651 --> 53:17.986
"Freeze!"

53:19.112 --> 53:20.280
Knowing my luck...

53:25.493 --> 53:26.786
"Fluffy?"

53:28.455 --> 53:29.998
"I said, freeze!"

53:31.166 --> 53:34.085
"Oh, you're funny.
You're funny, bro."

53:34.961 --> 53:37.713
"You're funny."
"Get on the ground!"

53:37.714 --> 53:39.591
"Oh!"

53:40.800 --> 53:42.509
"Don't make me shoot you."

53:42.510 --> 53:44.261
"Ah, hey!"

53:46.598 --> 53:51.061
"Hey, Beto, get in here! Get in here!
You'll never guess whose house this is!"

53:52.020 --> 53:53.312
The other guy runs in.

53:53.313 --> 53:56.441
"Oh, hey.
Oh, hey. Oh, hey. Oh, hey."

53:57.776 --> 53:59.276
"I grew up watching you."

54:06.618 --> 54:10.455
Next thing you know, I'm autographing
things they're about to take.

54:41.152 --> 54:44.738
So like I said, in this situation,
I feel like there's two kinds of people.

54:44.739 --> 54:48.492
One, people like me.
Had the guns, had the ammunition.

54:48.493 --> 54:50.995
Glad they weren't home,
but if they would have been home,

54:50.996 --> 54:54.164
they would have done something about it.
That's one type of people.

54:54.165 --> 55:00.130
The other kind of people are
the kind of people who cannot wait

55:00.922 --> 55:03.717
for the opportunity

55:04.426 --> 55:05.718
to...

55:05.719 --> 55:07.470
Oh.

55:09.973 --> 55:11.390
Good. You're here.

55:13.476 --> 55:17.104
The kind of people who cannot wait
for the opportunity

55:17.105 --> 55:19.106
to confront an intruder

55:19.107 --> 55:24.445
because you know you have way more guns
and ammunition than they do,

55:24.446 --> 55:27.740
and you are prepared for war.

55:32.537 --> 55:36.833
The kind of people who sit home at night
in the living room, in the dark,

55:37.334 --> 55:38.335
holding their gun.

55:45.884 --> 55:48.552
They leave the front door unlocked
to make it easier.

55:50.930 --> 55:54.934
And people like that always have a friend
either across the street or across town.

55:56.019 --> 55:58.187
"How is everything
over there on your side?"

55:58.188 --> 56:01.065
"It's all clear over here. How about you?"

56:01.066 --> 56:04.027
"Yeah. Coast is clear.
Ten-four. Out." There.

56:10.241 --> 56:11.409
This situation,

56:12.410 --> 56:15.120
the break-in, left me traumatized.

56:15.121 --> 56:18.499
I couldn't go back to living in the house
because I didn't feel safe.

56:18.500 --> 56:20.752
It's just me and two chihuahuas.

56:21.711 --> 56:22.669
Yeah, that's it.

56:22.670 --> 56:26.006
I'm no longer with my son's mom,
and my son lives with his mom.

56:26.007 --> 56:27.216
So, you know...

56:27.217 --> 56:30.636
And by the way, I told my son Frankie
what happened, about the break-in,

56:30.637 --> 56:32.304
and right away, right away,

56:32.305 --> 56:35.599
"Oh, really?
They're lucky I wasn't there."

56:37.727 --> 56:40.187
I'm like, "<i>Cálmate</i>, John Wick."

56:42.440 --> 56:43.899
"They would've kidnapped you."

56:43.900 --> 56:46.069
"I would've had to pay double
to get you back."

56:49.114 --> 56:52.241
I could not go back
to living at the house.

56:52.242 --> 56:53.243
Again, it's just me.

56:53.827 --> 56:56.704
So, I put the house up for sale.

56:57.539 --> 56:58.956
Uh, yeah, I just couldn't.

56:58.957 --> 57:04.128
And it was a big beautiful home
that you guys helped pay for. Thank you.

57:05.547 --> 57:06.714
It was nice.

57:07.215 --> 57:08.340
Real nice.

57:08.341 --> 57:10.927
Freaking four bathrooms.

57:11.678 --> 57:14.179
Four bathrooms. Yeah.

57:14.180 --> 57:15.764
One penis.

57:17.725 --> 57:20.228
Even if I ran, I couldn't, you know...

57:22.021 --> 57:26.359
I put the house up for sale,
and here's the dilemma that I faced.

57:26.860 --> 57:30.446
I put it up for sale
before I had a new place to live

57:30.447 --> 57:33.866
because I figured I'm on the road,
I'm always in a tour bus, a plane,

57:33.867 --> 57:35.951
a hotel, always somewhere. I'm on the go.

57:35.952 --> 57:39.580
I was just trying to get ahead of it
because when I first bought the house,

57:39.581 --> 57:43.167
it was sitting on the market
for almost two years.

57:43.168 --> 57:45.377
So I thought I had time.

57:45.378 --> 57:49.298
What happened was it sold like that

57:49.299 --> 57:52.342
because I had two people bidding
on the house at the same time

57:52.343 --> 57:54.595
and they kept driving up the price.

57:54.596 --> 57:57.389
And one of the people
trying to buy the house,

57:57.390 --> 57:59.433
he wanted all of my furniture

57:59.434 --> 58:02.603
and so my agent for the house goes,
"Gabriel, this is crazy."

58:02.604 --> 58:04.605
"These two guys are bidding on your house,

58:04.606 --> 58:08.567
and they want to give you
way more than what you're asking."

58:08.568 --> 58:11.904
"One of them wants to give you
an extra $100,000

58:11.905 --> 58:13.614
for all of your furniture."

58:13.615 --> 58:15.617
"I suggest you take it."

58:16.159 --> 58:22.039
And so, I did. I sold the house
with everything, except the mattress.

58:22.040 --> 58:22.999
Everything.

58:27.587 --> 58:28.922
The problem is

58:30.632 --> 58:32.383
I don't have a house right now.

58:34.052 --> 58:37.930
I don't have anywhere to live,
so technically, I'm, um...

58:49.567 --> 58:51.527
Fuck it. I'm homeless. I don't care.

58:52.695 --> 58:53.613
I'll say it.

58:54.614 --> 58:55.657
I'll say it.

58:56.950 --> 58:59.660
I'm not gonna be "unhoused."
I'm homeless right now.

58:59.661 --> 59:00.702
They can't cancel me.

59:00.703 --> 59:03.622
What are they gonna do?
Take my house? I don't have one. Ha!

59:06.209 --> 59:08.586
So whatever. Mm.

59:09.587 --> 59:13.298
But no, at this point,
at... at 47 years of age,

59:13.299 --> 59:16.469
I don't need more stuff.

59:16.970 --> 59:20.305
I'm happy that I do have stuff,
but I don't need it.

59:20.306 --> 59:24.560
What I want more than anything else now
is better relationships.

59:24.561 --> 59:28.855
Better friendships,
better people in my life,

59:28.856 --> 59:31.526
that's what I want
more than anything else.

59:33.653 --> 59:36.738
I announced in my last special
at Dodger Stadium

59:36.739 --> 59:39.866
that I was no longer in a relationship.

59:39.867 --> 59:43.036
And I thought that was the best place
to announce that

59:43.037 --> 59:47.040
because I've been very open about my life,
my whole show is my life.

59:47.041 --> 59:48.458
People kept asking about her.

59:48.459 --> 59:50.962
So I thought that was the best place
to announce that.

59:51.713 --> 59:53.256
You know what happens

59:53.923 --> 59:58.552
when you tell 50,000 people
at a stadium that you're single

59:58.553 --> 01:00:02.432
and then Netflix airs that
around the world?

01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:09.480
I received thousands of "applications"

01:00:10.356 --> 01:00:12.774
for the Fluffy fulfillment center.

01:00:12.775 --> 01:00:13.900
Yes, I did.

01:00:16.237 --> 01:00:19.531
<i>That's right, Netflix.
Fluffy is hoein' out.</i>

01:00:20.950 --> 01:00:24.286
It was incredible.
It was exciting. It was overwhelming,

01:00:24.287 --> 01:00:29.207
And it was terrifying
because I didn't know what they wanted.

01:00:29.208 --> 01:00:33.629
Um, well, I'm gonna tell you
that since announcing that I was single,

01:00:33.630 --> 01:00:36.757
I've gone out on a few dates.

01:00:36.758 --> 01:00:39.636
And, uh, yeah.

01:00:40.762 --> 01:00:44.098
I don't want to say how many,
'cause I don't want your judgment.

01:00:45.350 --> 01:00:47.769
"Fluffy's a whore."

01:00:48.686 --> 01:00:50.647
"He's nasty."

01:00:51.230 --> 01:00:55.276
"He's like Santa
with all his ho ho hos, yeah."

01:00:57.612 --> 01:00:59.237
I still want to go out.

01:00:59.238 --> 01:01:01.948
I still want to have fun,
I want to make connections,

01:01:01.949 --> 01:01:06.370
but unfortunately,
I don't trust people. I'm afraid.

01:01:06.371 --> 01:01:11.583
I can meet people really easy,
but then I find out what they're up to,

01:01:11.584 --> 01:01:13.377
and that sucks.

01:01:13.378 --> 01:01:16.129
Um, my heart is guarded now.

01:01:16.130 --> 01:01:17.089
Super guarded.

01:01:17.090 --> 01:01:21.134
There's a wall and then a wall
and then a wall and a wall and a wall.

01:01:21.135 --> 01:01:23.887
I'm like the only Mexican who likes walls.

01:01:28.976 --> 01:01:31.562
So moving forward, I can tell you

01:01:32.188 --> 01:01:35.524
I don't want to be
in another relationship.

01:01:35.525 --> 01:01:37.234
I'm actually doing okay.

01:01:37.235 --> 01:01:41.905
I still want to go out, but I don't want
to be in a committed relationship.

01:01:41.906 --> 01:01:43.990
I... I don't. No.

01:01:46.285 --> 01:01:47.745
What do you mean, "Boo"?

01:01:48.830 --> 01:01:50.372
The fact that I'm being honest

01:01:50.373 --> 01:01:52.749
about that I don't want
to be in a relationship,

01:01:52.750 --> 01:01:55.043
I think there's something to be said
about that.

01:01:55.044 --> 01:01:56.628
I could easily lie.

01:01:56.629 --> 01:01:59.256
Meet someone,
say that we're boyfriend/girlfriend,

01:01:59.257 --> 01:02:00.507
and have a thing.

01:02:00.508 --> 01:02:04.011
But does it mean anything
if your behavior doesn't change?

01:02:04.512 --> 01:02:05.846
I'm being up front and honest.

01:02:05.847 --> 01:02:08.557
All I want... All I want... All I want, watch...

01:02:08.558 --> 01:02:11.769
To the guy that booed me for saying
I don't want a relationship.

01:02:12.353 --> 01:02:16.399
Raise your hand so I can...
Okay, you're famous, so...

01:02:17.316 --> 01:02:19.192
- To you... What is your name?
-  Justin.

01:02:19.193 --> 01:02:20.777
- Justin?
- Dustin.

01:02:20.778 --> 01:02:22.070
Dustin. All right, Dustin.

01:02:22.071 --> 01:02:23.613
Sorry for... "Dustin!"

01:02:23.614 --> 01:02:26.534
Like, all right, "Chill, bitch." Yeah.

01:02:29.036 --> 01:02:31.163
Yeah, right? Freakin' "'Murica."

01:02:32.498 --> 01:02:34.000
All right, Dustin.

01:02:35.042 --> 01:02:38.128
Me not wanting to be
in a traditional relationship

01:02:38.129 --> 01:02:42.841
is a honest thing because,
uh, I can tell you,

01:02:42.842 --> 01:02:47.012
I don't want to be in a situation
where I'm obligated to participate

01:02:47.013 --> 01:02:50.474
in things that don't make me feel
like a good person.

01:02:50.475 --> 01:02:54.352
And at the age of 47,
I'm tired of arguing,

01:02:54.353 --> 01:02:57.523
yelling, feeling guilted,
feeling obligated,

01:02:58.316 --> 01:02:59.859
not smiling more.

01:03:02.361 --> 01:03:03.528
I'm good, man.

01:03:03.529 --> 01:03:08.200
I... You know... But I still want to go out.
So I just want to be up front and honest.

01:03:08.201 --> 01:03:12.330
All I need, Dustin,
watch, is someone to eat with.

01:03:17.293 --> 01:03:18.711
Someone to drink with.

01:03:20.546 --> 01:03:22.465
Someone to go to movies with.

01:03:24.008 --> 01:03:25.884
And someone to cuddle with.

01:03:28.346 --> 01:03:29.554
That's right.

01:03:29.555 --> 01:03:31.765
And they don't even gotta be
the same person.

01:03:33.184 --> 01:03:36.479
All I'm saying is sometimes
it takes a village. Okay?

01:03:38.523 --> 01:03:42.067
Dustin, I would love to tell a woman,
"Hey, would you like to go see a movie?"

01:03:42.068 --> 01:03:43.610
"Yeah." Then we go.

01:03:43.611 --> 01:03:45.695
After the movie's over,
I go, "What did you think?"

01:03:45.696 --> 01:03:46.696
"Good."

01:03:46.697 --> 01:03:47.614
"Right?"

01:03:47.615 --> 01:03:50.408
"Would you like to see another movie?"
"Sure. When?"

01:03:50.409 --> 01:03:51.368
"Next week?"

01:03:51.369 --> 01:03:52.327
"Good."

01:03:52.328 --> 01:03:54.371
"Let's stay in touch.
See you next week."

01:03:54.372 --> 01:03:57.290
"This is gonna be so cool.
You like rom-coms. I like rom-coms."

01:03:57.291 --> 01:03:59.167
"You like horror movies. I like horror."

01:03:59.168 --> 01:04:02.045
"This is gonna work. I like this.
I need this. [grunts] Can't wait."

01:04:02.046 --> 01:04:04.548
So I say, "All right, gotta go."
And she gets weird.

01:04:04.549 --> 01:04:06.591
"Wait, wait. Hold on. Hold on."

01:04:06.592 --> 01:04:09.010
"You gotta go?
I thought this was going good."

01:04:09.011 --> 01:04:12.514
"It's going great.
We'll do more next week. This is cool."

01:04:12.515 --> 01:04:14.349
"But what's the rush?"

01:04:14.350 --> 01:04:16.268
"Where are you headed? Where you going?"

01:04:16.269 --> 01:04:17.520
"Um..."

01:04:18.229 --> 01:04:22.315
"Uh, I'm about to call the cuddler. Why?"

01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:27.571
"The cuddler, what's that?"
"I got that covered."

01:04:27.572 --> 01:04:30.407
"Okay, movies, that's your lane.
Stay in it, okay?"

01:04:30.408 --> 01:04:34.245
"This is us. We're good.
Solid. You're the movie girl, okay?"

01:04:35.663 --> 01:04:36.664
Now, Dustin.

01:04:38.332 --> 01:04:39.584
I didn't tell her.

01:04:40.585 --> 01:04:41.961
But I'm gonna tell you.

01:04:43.254 --> 01:04:45.338
When it comes
to the department of cuddling,

01:04:45.339 --> 01:04:48.675
and this is so crazy
because I've always been in a relationship

01:04:48.676 --> 01:04:52.638
and I could never be this open and honest,
but now that I'm single,

01:04:53.139 --> 01:04:55.724
these are Fluffy's flavors.

01:04:57.351 --> 01:05:03.190
So, when it comes to the department
of cuddling, this is what I want.

01:05:03.816 --> 01:05:05.943
I want a woman.

01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:08.279
A woman.

01:05:09.196 --> 01:05:10.031
A woman.

01:05:11.115 --> 01:05:14.492
With original factory settings.

01:05:24.629 --> 01:05:29.425
This woman needs to be equal to,
or greater than,

01:05:30.301 --> 01:05:32.053
in size.

01:05:32.553 --> 01:05:34.638
She needs to be a big girl.

01:05:34.639 --> 01:05:36.973
I prefer a big girl.

01:05:36.974 --> 01:05:39.935
I want a big girl.

01:05:39.936 --> 01:05:41.895
Oh yeah. Oh yeah.

01:05:41.896 --> 01:05:45.982
This way, we both can agree
on the temperature of the thermostat.

01:05:48.819 --> 01:05:51.529
And only big girls know
what I'm talkin' about.

01:05:52.865 --> 01:05:57.452
See, I'm a big boy, and as a big boy,
I always run hot.

01:05:57.453 --> 01:05:59.329
Heat affects my mood.

01:05:59.330 --> 01:06:04.417
When I'm hot, Dustin, I become irritable,
cranky, my anxiety goes through the roof.

01:06:04.418 --> 01:06:10.090
So for me to feel comfortable,
I like to set the room to 68 degrees.

01:06:10.091 --> 01:06:11.007
Okay?

01:06:12.343 --> 01:06:13.260
That's right.

01:06:14.303 --> 01:06:16.973
And only a big girl
can truly appreciate that.

01:06:18.391 --> 01:06:20.726
Skinny women, not so much.

01:06:21.394 --> 01:06:27.357
And let me tell you, I am tired
of disappointing, skinny, cold women.

01:06:28.401 --> 01:06:31.821
Skinny, cold women are mean.

01:06:32.697 --> 01:06:35.865
They're mean.
They don't want it at freakin' 68 degrees.

01:06:35.866 --> 01:06:37.993
No, they want 72, 73, 74.

01:06:37.994 --> 01:06:40.121
You're killing me. No!

01:06:40.955 --> 01:06:44.457
But I can't do that to them.
I can't put them in 68 degrees.

01:06:44.458 --> 01:06:45.542
They get snippy.

01:06:45.543 --> 01:06:49.045
They get evil. They're like,
"Oh my God. What's your problem?"

01:06:49.046 --> 01:06:52.340
"It's so cold.
It's so cold. It's so cold."

01:06:52.341 --> 01:06:55.594
"Well, fuckin' eat something."

01:06:56.429 --> 01:06:58.055
"I'm tired of sweating."

01:07:01.017 --> 01:07:01.892
But, yeah.

01:07:02.727 --> 01:07:04.686
Anyway, Dustin, I apologize.

01:07:04.687 --> 01:07:07.105
I wasn't trying to turn this
into a TED Talk.

01:07:09.316 --> 01:07:14.195
I don't want you to think
that I don't believe in love

01:07:14.196 --> 01:07:18.033
because I do,
and anyone who can pull it off,

01:07:18.034 --> 01:07:19.909
I commend you for it.

01:07:19.910 --> 01:07:22.412
I have met so many couples over the years.

01:07:22.413 --> 01:07:24.622
I've met 20-year couples,

01:07:24.623 --> 01:07:27.125
30-year couples, 40-year couples,

01:07:27.126 --> 01:07:28.501
50-year couples.

01:07:28.502 --> 01:07:31.296
I met one 55.

01:07:31.297 --> 01:07:33.506
Yeah. Yeah.

01:07:33.507 --> 01:07:34.884
I call them unicorns.

01:07:37.136 --> 01:07:38.386
I'll tell you the story.

01:07:38.387 --> 01:07:40.555
I was in Savannah, Georgia.

01:07:40.556 --> 01:07:45.436
And I had just finished filming
the second <i>Magic Mike</i> movie.

01:07:46.062 --> 01:07:47.187
Now...

01:07:47.188 --> 01:07:50.065
Yeah, I know.
For those of you that don't know,

01:07:50.066 --> 01:07:52.275
I was in <i>Magic Mike.</i>

01:07:53.903 --> 01:07:54.820
Yes.

01:07:55.613 --> 01:07:57.739
I know. I was the only one
who didn't get naked.

01:07:59.742 --> 01:08:02.787
<i>Magic Mike</i>, not Tragic Mike.
So, let's remember that, okay?

01:08:03.579 --> 01:08:06.247
I was the only one
who didn't get naked. So, um...

01:08:06.248 --> 01:08:09.167
Here's the thing,
after the movie, after we wrapped,

01:08:09.168 --> 01:08:11.753
my manager, Joe,
tells me, he says, "Dude, man."

01:08:11.754 --> 01:08:13.588
"Congratulations on another project."

01:08:13.589 --> 01:08:15.757
"I want to take you out
for a steak dinner."

01:08:15.758 --> 01:08:16.966
I said, "Let's go."

01:08:16.967 --> 01:08:20.470
So he takes me to this restaurant called
Ruth's Chris Steak House.

01:08:20.471 --> 01:08:23.264
Now, very popular chain
around the country.

01:08:23.265 --> 01:08:24.808
We go there, we sit down,

01:08:24.809 --> 01:08:27.977
and here comes the server
and the server's real bubbly.

01:08:27.978 --> 01:08:32.232
"Hey, guys. What's going on?
Are we celebrating anything today?"

01:08:32.233 --> 01:08:34.192
"Actually, yes, we are."

01:08:34.193 --> 01:08:36.569
"Well, guess what?
You're not the only ones."

01:08:36.570 --> 01:08:38.279
"You see that couple over there?"

01:08:38.280 --> 01:08:43.076
"That couple is celebrating
55 years of marriage today."

01:08:43.077 --> 01:08:44.787
And we're like, "What?"

01:08:45.454 --> 01:08:46.288
So, we look.

01:08:49.291 --> 01:08:51.626
I said, "How come they're not talking?"

01:08:53.671 --> 01:08:55.255
"I wondered the same thing,

01:08:55.256 --> 01:08:57.590
but the man made it a point
to say 55 years."

01:08:57.591 --> 01:08:59.509
"I thought that was pretty impressive."

01:08:59.510 --> 01:09:00.802
I go, "No, it is."

01:09:00.803 --> 01:09:04.180
So he leaves to go get us some sodas
and some bread.

01:09:04.181 --> 01:09:06.641
And I tell my manager,
I said, "Hey, Joe, listen."

01:09:06.642 --> 01:09:08.685
"I'mma go say hi
to the couple real quick."

01:09:08.686 --> 01:09:11.396
"Don't get us kicked out."
"I'm not gonna."

01:09:11.397 --> 01:09:14.774
"Don't make it like last time."
"It's not gonna be."

01:09:14.775 --> 01:09:20.822
So I get up, and I push in my chair,
and I make my way over to the couple.

01:09:20.823 --> 01:09:25.743
Now, I understand how important
this night is for them.

01:09:25.744 --> 01:09:30.498
I know exactly
how long it took to get to that point,

01:09:30.499 --> 01:09:33.669
and I am not trying to mess that up.

01:09:34.879 --> 01:09:36.129
But I have questions.

01:09:37.464 --> 01:09:42.469
And these two people are clearly
professionals in that department.

01:09:43.470 --> 01:09:46.347
So I approached the table
as tactfully as I could.

01:09:46.348 --> 01:09:48.601
And I said, "Pardon the interruption."

01:09:49.226 --> 01:09:53.354
"It has come to my attention
that we are celebrating

01:09:53.355 --> 01:09:56.191
55 years of marriage."

01:09:56.192 --> 01:10:01.696
And the man was so happy that someone
acknowledged that. He was just thrilled.

01:10:01.697 --> 01:10:02.864
He's like...

01:10:07.870 --> 01:10:09.371
"That's right, son."

01:10:09.914 --> 01:10:12.124
"Fifty-five years ago today,

01:10:15.961 --> 01:10:19.464
this lovely lady
sittin' next to me right here

01:10:19.465 --> 01:10:25.053
said I do,
and we've been together ever since."

01:10:25.054 --> 01:10:27.055
"That is beautiful."

01:10:27.056 --> 01:10:28.766
"May I ask you a question?"

01:10:32.645 --> 01:10:33.979
"Absolutely."

01:10:35.814 --> 01:10:37.523
"How come you're not talking?"

01:10:49.119 --> 01:10:52.121
"He wants to know how come we're...
Laugh, goddammit."

01:10:58.462 --> 01:11:03.049
"Son, when you've been together
as long as the two of us have,

01:11:03.050 --> 01:11:06.177
you might've seen a thing or two."

01:11:06.178 --> 01:11:07.470
Uh, uh...

01:11:07.471 --> 01:11:12.475
"We have children,
grandchildren, great-grandchildren."

01:11:12.476 --> 01:11:17.397
"We have traveled this great big world
of ours many times over."

01:11:17.398 --> 01:11:19.565
"We're both retired military."

01:11:19.566 --> 01:11:23.486
"We have seen the best in people."

01:11:23.487 --> 01:11:26.948
"And, unfortunately,
when you're around and alive

01:11:26.949 --> 01:11:29.826
as long as the two of us have been, uh,

01:11:29.827 --> 01:11:34.623
you've unfortunately seen
the worst in people as well."

01:11:35.624 --> 01:11:41.462
"We have had
just about every type of conversation

01:11:41.463 --> 01:11:42.672
there is to have.

01:11:45.426 --> 01:11:47.093
At least twice.

01:11:49.513 --> 01:11:51.723
And after 55 years of marriage,

01:11:51.724 --> 01:11:56.561
well, hell, we're just trying
to enjoy each other's company,

01:11:56.562 --> 01:11:58.230
even if it's in silence."

01:11:59.732 --> 01:12:05.695
I said, "You've had every type
of conversation there is to have?"

01:12:05.696 --> 01:12:09.115
And I guess I triggered him,
because he was like,

01:12:09.116 --> 01:12:10.367
"Look at me!"

01:12:11.535 --> 01:12:12.619
"Look at me!"

01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:14.913
"I've been in combat."

01:12:15.789 --> 01:12:17.582
"Nothing can faze me."

01:12:17.583 --> 01:12:19.877
"Nothing can surprise me anymore."

01:12:21.503 --> 01:12:24.255
"You don't say."

01:12:24.256 --> 01:12:28.885
So, I took a step towards them,
I grab my shirt, and I flash them.

01:12:30.679 --> 01:12:32.348
And then I walked away.

01:12:33.515 --> 01:12:35.266
And you know what happened next?

01:12:35.267 --> 01:12:37.018
They started talking!

01:12:39.313 --> 01:12:43.734
I gave that couple the greatest gift
they will never ever acknowledge.

01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:47.653
Something new, something spontaneous,
something outrageous,

01:12:47.654 --> 01:12:50.615
something neither one of them
had ever seen before.

01:12:50.616 --> 01:12:52.283
I gave them a new story.

01:12:52.284 --> 01:12:53.201
I promise you,

01:12:53.202 --> 01:12:56.496
every year moving forward,
all they're gonna talk about is

01:12:56.497 --> 01:12:58.832
what happened at 55.

01:12:59.792 --> 01:13:03.294
"Remember, honey.
Remember when that Samoan flashed us?"

01:13:05.255 --> 01:13:06.340
Right.

01:13:07.841 --> 01:13:09.134
'Cause I'm a giver.

01:13:12.137 --> 01:13:14.305
I remember many, many years ago,

01:13:14.306 --> 01:13:17.642
before there was a venue like this
to perform in,

01:13:17.643 --> 01:13:21.354
the only place around here
for comedians to do shows

01:13:21.355 --> 01:13:25.233
was at a comedy club
right outside these doors

01:13:25.234 --> 01:13:28.694
that was part of the original layout
of the casino.

01:13:30.989 --> 01:13:34.118
It was a club called The Improv.
There's a chain all over.

01:13:38.163 --> 01:13:42.083
And, you know, many,
many years ago, before all of this,

01:13:42.084 --> 01:13:45.044
that's where Martin
and myself, my buddy Alfred,

01:13:45.045 --> 01:13:48.131
we'd go do shows at the... at the club.

01:13:48.132 --> 01:13:51.885
And the first time we got a chance
to perform there,

01:13:52.386 --> 01:13:54.345
I didn't really have a name.

01:13:54.346 --> 01:13:56.347
I wasn't really established yet.

01:13:56.348 --> 01:13:59.434
And I want to take this moment
to acknowledge and thank one person

01:13:59.435 --> 01:14:02.145
who was super, super helpful in that,

01:14:02.146 --> 01:14:05.523
a man by the name of DJ Laz.

01:14:11.864 --> 01:14:14.324
That's right, people.
The Pimp with the Limp.

01:14:15.075 --> 01:14:16.325
Oh, yeah, <i>Papá</i>. Yeah.

01:14:16.326 --> 01:14:19.829
"It's your boy, DJ Laz."
I love him, man. He's great. He's awesome.

01:14:19.830 --> 01:14:22.290
But yeah, he walks in circles. He does.

01:14:22.291 --> 01:14:24.083
He walks in circles. Nice guy.

01:14:24.084 --> 01:14:27.128
DJ Laz was one of the first people

01:14:27.129 --> 01:14:31.215
to allow me to be
on morning radio with him,

01:14:31.216 --> 01:14:33.593
and he helped promote my shows.

01:14:33.594 --> 01:14:38.347
Not only would he allow me to go
on his show and promote my shows,

01:14:38.348 --> 01:14:42.310
he would come to my shows,
and he would bring people,

01:14:42.311 --> 01:14:45.021
and he'd watch and he'd sit
and hang out and laugh.

01:14:45.022 --> 01:14:49.192
The man has a million things he can do
in Miami, but he'd come watch my show.

01:14:49.193 --> 01:14:51.944
And then the next day,
"<i>Papá</i>, come on the radio with me."

01:14:51.945 --> 01:14:53.654
"We're gonna talk about your show."

01:14:53.655 --> 01:14:58.367
And he would help me sell out these shows
year after year after year.

01:14:58.368 --> 01:14:59.703
So, Laz,

01:15:00.454 --> 01:15:03.206
I know you're watching, <i>Papá</i>. Thank you.

01:15:03.207 --> 01:15:04.790
This is part of you, <i>Papá</i>.

01:15:04.791 --> 01:15:05.876
<i>Muchas gracias.</i>

01:15:06.919 --> 01:15:07.753
Thank you.

01:15:08.921 --> 01:15:09.963
Thank you.

01:15:14.384 --> 01:15:16.844
But that was many years down the line.

01:15:16.845 --> 01:15:18.638
In the beginning,

01:15:18.639 --> 01:15:21.015
the first time I performed
at that comedy club,

01:15:21.016 --> 01:15:24.185
right outside these doors,
that's no longer there...

01:15:24.186 --> 01:15:27.438
Um, I'm talking to the marketing person.

01:15:27.439 --> 01:15:31.108
Now, keep in mind, this is so long ago,
there was no social media.

01:15:31.109 --> 01:15:34.570
There was no TikTok, no freaking Twitter,
no Facebook, none of that.

01:15:34.571 --> 01:15:37.323
The only way you could
promote yourself back then was,

01:15:37.324 --> 01:15:39.867
you had to get
on morning radio, morning news,

01:15:39.868 --> 01:15:42.411
have somebody do a write-up on you
in the newspaper.

01:15:42.412 --> 01:15:43.497
Remember those?

01:15:44.039 --> 01:15:48.751
Yeah. And then, of course,
word-of-mouth, which is always the best.

01:15:48.752 --> 01:15:51.254
Uh, they had posters at the comedy club.

01:15:51.255 --> 01:15:54.174
And so, the marketing guy goes, "Gabriel."

01:15:54.925 --> 01:15:57.094
"Help me help you help us."

01:15:58.136 --> 01:16:02.265
"We want to sell tickets.
How do you want to be promoted?"

01:16:02.266 --> 01:16:03.891
I said, "Well..."

01:16:03.892 --> 01:16:05.476
Keep in mind, long time ago.

01:16:05.477 --> 01:16:08.396
I said, "Um, this is how I want you
to promote my show."

01:16:08.397 --> 01:16:10.023
"Please use a photo."

01:16:10.524 --> 01:16:13.150
"Under the photo,
put my name, Gabriel Iglesias."

01:16:13.151 --> 01:16:16.571
I didn't have the nickname Fluffy yet.
That's how long ago this was.

01:16:16.572 --> 01:16:21.492
I said, "Underneath that,
please put, 'As seen on Comedy Central.'"

01:16:21.493 --> 01:16:25.663
Because at the time,
that was the only television credit I had.

01:16:25.664 --> 01:16:29.667
So the marketing guy goes,
"Well, I was thinking, what about,

01:16:29.668 --> 01:16:34.005
'Gabriel Iglesias and his <i>amigos</i>'?"

01:16:39.803 --> 01:16:40.971
<i>"'Amigos'?"</i>

01:16:42.055 --> 01:16:43.180
"Why <i>'amigos'?"</i>

01:16:43.181 --> 01:16:45.559
"Because I have other Mexicans with me?"

01:16:46.143 --> 01:16:49.395
And he looked at me
and said, "Good. You get it."

01:16:51.607 --> 01:16:56.736
"I don't like that. What about
'Gabriel Iglesias and friends'?"

01:16:56.737 --> 01:16:59.280
"Well, we want to put
a couple of buzzwords out there

01:16:59.281 --> 01:17:01.949
to let the community know
what type of show it is."

01:17:01.950 --> 01:17:05.077
I said, "What type of show is it?"
"It's a special show."

01:17:05.078 --> 01:17:06.912
"I don't feel special."

01:17:06.913 --> 01:17:10.208
"Gabriel, hear me out.
What about like a taco Tuesday?"

01:17:11.335 --> 01:17:14.254
"I don't like it."
"Okay, what about salsa night?"

01:17:14.755 --> 01:17:15.964
"Salsa night?"

01:17:17.507 --> 01:17:19.467
"Wait, like dancing or chips and guac?"

01:17:20.552 --> 01:17:22.262
"Either one, I don't like it."

01:17:24.389 --> 01:17:26.807
I could not believe
I was having this conversation,

01:17:26.808 --> 01:17:28.476
and I wanted to get upset.

01:17:28.477 --> 01:17:30.019
I wanted to go off on this guy

01:17:30.020 --> 01:17:32.730
for trying to make me feel
like less of a person, right?

01:17:32.731 --> 01:17:36.859
But I didn't, because I knew
that if I went off on them,

01:17:36.860 --> 01:17:39.028
I would have been seen as difficult.

01:17:39.029 --> 01:17:41.113
I would have been seen as a problem,

01:17:41.114 --> 01:17:44.867
and I would not have been given
another opportunity to come back.

01:17:44.868 --> 01:17:47.995
When people ask me,
"What do you credit for your success?"

01:17:47.996 --> 01:17:51.248
Of course, talent,
showing up, doing what you gotta do.

01:17:51.249 --> 01:17:54.419
But one word that gets left out a lot
is the word "sacrifice."

01:17:55.128 --> 01:17:57.797
I had to sacrifice something that day,

01:17:57.798 --> 01:18:00.758
and a lot of people think they know
what sacrifice means

01:18:00.759 --> 01:18:04.387
but honestly, until you have to make one,
I don't think you do.

01:18:04.388 --> 01:18:06.931
I had to sacrifice my pride

01:18:06.932 --> 01:18:09.934
because as much as I wanted
to go off on this guy,

01:18:09.935 --> 01:18:12.812
I knew that if I did,
I'd be shooting myself in the foot.

01:18:12.813 --> 01:18:16.148
I knew that if they could see
what I could do on that stage,

01:18:16.149 --> 01:18:20.069
they'd have to bring me back,
and they'd have to treat me different.

01:18:27.536 --> 01:18:30.037
So as much as it hurt,
as much as it sucked,

01:18:30.038 --> 01:18:33.249
I allowed that stupid taco Tuesday
to happen.

01:18:33.250 --> 01:18:36.837
So, for me, I was very upset.

01:18:37.337 --> 01:18:41.006
I was wondering, is this something
that happens to all new comedians,

01:18:41.007 --> 01:18:43.050
or was I being singled out?

01:18:43.051 --> 01:18:45.511
It was killing me. I needed to know.

01:18:45.512 --> 01:18:47.722
I couldn't just take out my phone
and google it

01:18:47.723 --> 01:18:51.059
because that wasn't an option
all those years back.

01:18:51.852 --> 01:18:55.354
So what I had to do was I had to go
to the front door of the club

01:18:55.355 --> 01:18:58.691
where they had a bin,
and the bin had flyers in it.

01:18:58.692 --> 01:19:00.985
So I grabbed the flyer,
and I looked at it.

01:19:00.986 --> 01:19:04.530
And the flyer had the list
of upcoming comedy shows.

01:19:04.531 --> 01:19:07.533
And I was so upset when I saw it

01:19:07.534 --> 01:19:11.871
because all it was, was pictures,
names, and television credits.

01:19:11.872 --> 01:19:16.625
No silly names, no theme nights,
no "spicy this" or "crazy that."

01:19:16.626 --> 01:19:17.960
Just comedy.

01:19:17.961 --> 01:19:21.255
So I said, "Why are they doing
this stupid taco Tuesday thing to me?"

01:19:21.256 --> 01:19:23.591
So I said, "Let me try
to find another comedian

01:19:23.592 --> 01:19:26.845
who's a little bit more in my vein."

01:19:27.637 --> 01:19:29.264
If you know what I mean.

01:19:30.015 --> 01:19:32.642
The only other comedian I could find

01:19:33.226 --> 01:19:36.061
was a man by the name of George Lopez.

01:19:41.985 --> 01:19:46.155
With George's promo,
however, it was just a picture, name,

01:19:46.156 --> 01:19:47.281
and underneath that,

01:19:47.282 --> 01:19:51.535
a television credit that said,
"As seen on ABC."

01:19:51.536 --> 01:19:52.453
That's it.

01:19:52.454 --> 01:19:56.123
It didn't say,
"Likes to ride a donkey, George Lopez,"

01:19:56.124 --> 01:19:59.168
"Eats a burrito
with both hands, George Lopez."

01:19:59.169 --> 01:20:03.464
"Ay, ay, ay. I just jumped the wall.
It's George Lopez." No!

01:20:03.465 --> 01:20:05.174
So I said,
"Why are they doing this to me?"

01:20:05.175 --> 01:20:07.301
So then I said, "All right, all right."

01:20:07.302 --> 01:20:11.723
"Let me see
how they promote the Black comedians."

01:20:12.224 --> 01:20:15.643
And with the Black comedians,
it was the same thing.

01:20:15.644 --> 01:20:19.731
Picture, name, television credit,
and that's it.

01:20:20.232 --> 01:20:26.403
Unless it was a show
that had multiple Black comedians on it

01:20:26.404 --> 01:20:30.908
because if the comedy club had a show
with three or more Black comics on it,

01:20:30.909 --> 01:20:32.910
they would put a catchy name to it.

01:20:32.911 --> 01:20:35.287
They would call the show "Urban Night"

01:20:35.288 --> 01:20:38.541
or "Apollo Night"
or "Def Jam Comedy Night,"

01:20:38.542 --> 01:20:41.669
"BET Comedy Night,"
"Black-ish Comedy Night."

01:20:41.670 --> 01:20:43.254
But that's as far as they would go.

01:20:43.255 --> 01:20:45.714
They wouldn't go to the next level
like they would for me.

01:20:45.715 --> 01:20:49.885
Oh, yeah. There was no "Margarita Monday"
or "Taco Tuesday"

01:20:49.886 --> 01:20:53.556
or "Wetback Wednesday"
or "Tortilla Thursday,"

01:20:53.557 --> 01:20:56.935
or "<i>Fiesta</i> Friday,"
or <i>"Sábado Gigante</i>"! No.

01:20:58.812 --> 01:21:01.355
That would never happen to Black people.
Are you kidding me?

01:21:01.356 --> 01:21:04.567
You'll never see a "Malt Liquor Monday"

01:21:04.568 --> 01:21:08.571
or "Tupac Tuesday,"
or "Watermelon Wednesday"

01:21:08.572 --> 01:21:10.823
or "Thong, Th-Thong, Thong Thursday,"

01:21:10.824 --> 01:21:14.243
or "Fried Chicken Friday"
or "Sookie-Sookie Saturday"

01:21:14.244 --> 01:21:16.203
or "Slap-a-Ho Sunday"!

01:21:20.667 --> 01:21:24.963
And that most definitely will not happen
to white people.

01:21:58.121 --> 01:21:59.456
Oh, I'mma do the joke.

01:22:01.041 --> 01:22:04.168
And you know why you can laugh
and enjoy and not feel threatened

01:22:04.169 --> 01:22:05.461
by what I'm about to say?

01:22:05.462 --> 01:22:07.922
Because, like what I said earlier tonight,

01:22:07.923 --> 01:22:12.761
I am here to entertain,
I am not here to offend.

01:22:13.261 --> 01:22:16.890
I'm here to have fun with everybody,
starting with me.

01:22:18.266 --> 01:22:20.936
Plus, it'll never happen.

01:22:21.436 --> 01:22:27.483
You'll never see a "Monster Truck Monday"
or "Trailer Park Tuesday"

01:22:27.484 --> 01:22:31.654
or "White Trash Wednesday"
or "Take Your Sister Out Thursday."

01:22:33.865 --> 01:22:37.285
"Oh, hell no, Fluffy!
You done crossed the line now!"

01:22:37.994 --> 01:22:40.705
"My name is Dustin,
and I don't play that shit."

01:22:51.216 --> 01:22:53.175
"I'm from Davie, goddammit."

01:23:01.226 --> 01:23:02.643
Next time, stay quiet.

01:23:04.813 --> 01:23:05.855
So...

01:23:10.110 --> 01:23:12.736
I was talking to Martin backstage
before I came out,

01:23:12.737 --> 01:23:17.116
and he goes, "Are you gonna share
the story about the theme nights thing

01:23:17.117 --> 01:23:19.743
that happened
at The Improv here, and y'know?"

01:23:19.744 --> 01:23:22.579
I go, "Well, y'know,
I think I should, Martin."

01:23:22.580 --> 01:23:26.083
"I think I should tell the story
about, y'know, the theme nights."

01:23:26.084 --> 01:23:29.128
He goes, "Gabe, can I tell you something
about that theme nights bit?"

01:23:29.129 --> 01:23:30.671
I go, "Tell me, Martin."

01:23:30.672 --> 01:23:33.799
"Do you realize
that in all the years

01:23:33.800 --> 01:23:38.679
I have heard you tell this story
about what happened at that club,

01:23:38.680 --> 01:23:42.308
do you understand that you've never once

01:23:43.268 --> 01:23:44.893
finished the week?"

01:23:48.815 --> 01:23:51.608
I said, "Martin,
you know why that is, right?"

01:23:51.609 --> 01:23:53.318
"It's the rule of comedy."

01:23:53.319 --> 01:23:56.280
"You always want to end
on the biggest laugh."

01:23:56.281 --> 01:23:59.658
"Thursday gets the biggest laugh,
which is why I stopped at Thursday."

01:23:59.659 --> 01:24:03.746
And Martin goes, "I know, I know, I know."

01:24:03.747 --> 01:24:06.165
"But you're robbing white people
of their week."

01:24:12.297 --> 01:24:14.049
I never looked at it that way.

01:24:15.550 --> 01:24:17.301
"Fox News Friday."

01:24:18.553 --> 01:24:20.679
"Storm the Capitol Saturday."

01:24:22.849 --> 01:24:24.933
"Say You're Sorry Sunday"!

01:24:27.604 --> 01:24:29.563
Are we still havin' a good time?

01:24:32.692 --> 01:24:34.610
Are we still having fun?

01:24:40.700 --> 01:24:42.785
That's what I'm talkin' about.

01:24:42.786 --> 01:24:46.830
People laughing, not getting upset,
not getting offended,

01:24:46.831 --> 01:24:48.582
not freakin' making a stink.

01:24:48.583 --> 01:24:50.751
And let me tell you right now,
for the five people

01:24:50.752 --> 01:24:55.547
who have never heard of me before,
this... is for you.

01:24:57.842 --> 01:24:59.510
I get pulled over one night,

01:24:59.511 --> 01:25:02.679
two minutes after coming out
of a Krispy Kreme drive-through.

01:25:07.018 --> 01:25:09.144
I made a left turn
instead of making a right turn,

01:25:09.145 --> 01:25:11.814
but I wasn't paying attention,
'cause I had a box, right?

01:25:11.815 --> 01:25:14.191
I was like, "Oh, you're gonna get it."

01:25:17.695 --> 01:25:19.906
"You're gonna get it."

01:25:21.825 --> 01:25:23.534
I make a wrong turn all of a sudden.

01:25:28.832 --> 01:25:29.706
"Later."

01:25:34.462 --> 01:25:37.422
The officer is taking forever.
I said, "Forget this."

01:25:37.423 --> 01:25:39.967
I grab the box of donuts.
I put it on my lap.

01:25:39.968 --> 01:25:41.468
I flipped it open. I was like...

01:25:41.469 --> 01:25:43.178
Mm!

01:25:43.179 --> 01:25:45.473
Ah!

01:25:48.726 --> 01:25:53.272
And just as I was about to tear it up,
the officer gets to the window,

01:25:53.273 --> 01:25:56.150
and he's like,
"You know why I stopped you?"

01:25:56.151 --> 01:25:58.193
It was too easy.

01:25:58.194 --> 01:26:00.445
I picked up the box, and I said...

01:26:00.446 --> 01:26:03.198
"'Cause you can smell it!"

01:26:21.885 --> 01:26:28.098
Fluffy! Fluffy!
Fluffy! Fluffy! Fluffy! Fluffy!

01:26:28.099 --> 01:26:34.605
Fluffy! Fluffy! Fluffy! Fluffy!
Fluffy! Fluffy! Fluffy! Fluffy!

01:26:46.743 --> 01:26:51.163
<i>You're probably wondering,
why did we pause the special</i> again<i>?</i>

01:26:51.164 --> 01:26:54.875
<i>Well, I just want to let you guys know
most comedians would've already said,</i>

01:26:54.876 --> 01:26:58.545
<i>"Thank you, good night," gone home,
cashed their Netflix checks,</i>

01:26:58.546 --> 01:27:00.339
<i>and hope they get another phone call.</i>

01:27:00.340 --> 01:27:02.174
<i>"Please call me, Netflix."</i>

01:27:02.175 --> 01:27:04.927
<i>But this guy
is not most comedians.</i>

01:27:04.928 --> 01:27:07.054
<i>That's what happens
when you hire a Mexican.</i>

01:27:07.055 --> 01:27:08.722
<i>We love overtime.</i>

01:27:10.141 --> 01:27:16.146
Thank you for still wanting to hear
a joke that's over 20 years old.

01:27:20.902 --> 01:27:22.528
I grew up watching you too.

01:27:24.697 --> 01:27:25.864
Got chills when I...

01:27:25.865 --> 01:27:27.199
Look, look.

01:27:30.245 --> 01:27:31.870
That was beautiful.

01:27:31.871 --> 01:27:35.832
I love you too, and that...
Seriously, you guys, thank you for that.

01:27:35.833 --> 01:27:36.750
Thank you.

01:27:38.461 --> 01:27:39.587
Thank you.

01:27:42.840 --> 01:27:44.591
There are fans,

01:27:44.592 --> 01:27:47.428
and then there's
what you just did right now.

01:27:52.016 --> 01:27:56.144
I don't know any other comedian
that gets this type of love and loyalty.

01:27:56.145 --> 01:27:57.312
Thank you so much.

01:27:57.313 --> 01:28:01.316
I'm not getting off the stage yet
'cause I still got more to go,

01:28:01.317 --> 01:28:03.360
but I want to say thank you for that.

01:28:05.947 --> 01:28:07.115
Thank you.

01:28:18.710 --> 01:28:19.711
Whoo!

01:28:21.212 --> 01:28:23.755
So when I started doing stand-up in 1997,

01:28:23.756 --> 01:28:28.136
the only place that would allow me
to go up on stage and do what I do

01:28:28.636 --> 01:28:29.679
were bars.

01:28:30.430 --> 01:28:33.056
Dive bars, rough bars.

01:28:33.057 --> 01:28:36.393
Uh, Martin and I,
that's where we met, many, many years ago.

01:28:36.394 --> 01:28:39.479
We're performing at this bar
in Montebello, California,

01:28:39.480 --> 01:28:42.649
and, uh, you had to fight with the crowd.

01:28:42.650 --> 01:28:44.818
You had to fight because there was noise.

01:28:44.819 --> 01:28:46.111
There were TVs on.

01:28:46.112 --> 01:28:49.364
People were drinking, smoking...
People were doing everything in there

01:28:49.365 --> 01:28:50.949
but paying attention.

01:28:50.950 --> 01:28:54.494
So you had to come out quick,
trying to get them to laugh.

01:28:54.495 --> 01:28:57.873
And one night,
this comedian pulls me aside,

01:28:57.874 --> 01:28:59.459
and he goes, "Hey, kid."

01:29:00.251 --> 01:29:02.502
And when he called me kid, I got upset.

01:29:02.503 --> 01:29:04.171
I'm like, "I could drink."

01:29:06.758 --> 01:29:11.720
I was 20, 21 years old, and, you know,
even though I thought I was grown,

01:29:11.721 --> 01:29:13.013
I wasn't.

01:29:13.014 --> 01:29:14.222
I wasn't grown.

01:29:14.223 --> 01:29:16.516
Uh, I got upset that he pulled me aside.

01:29:16.517 --> 01:29:18.352
He goes, "Can I give you some advice?"

01:29:18.353 --> 01:29:21.773
I'm like, "Who does this guy think he is?
I'm funnier than him."

01:29:22.648 --> 01:29:26.193
That's what I thought
because at the age of 21, I was a punk.

01:29:26.194 --> 01:29:27.403
I really was.

01:29:27.945 --> 01:29:32.240
And so, I don't know what got into me
where I said,

01:29:32.241 --> 01:29:33.951
"Sure, I'll hear you out."

01:29:34.452 --> 01:29:36.871
And I just stood there,
and he said, "Listen."

01:29:38.039 --> 01:29:43.002
"Um, you're really likeable on stage,
and that's rare."

01:29:43.503 --> 01:29:45.128
"I'm gonna give you a bit of advice."

01:29:45.129 --> 01:29:49.050
"If you cut all the cussing
out of your show

01:29:49.717 --> 01:29:52.302
and start taking the filthy material out,

01:29:52.303 --> 01:29:55.306
I think you're gonna have
a long career ahead of you."

01:29:55.807 --> 01:30:01.728
And I know I said "take the cussing out"
and I... I said the F-word twice tonight.

01:30:03.815 --> 01:30:06.316
Technically, no, three times.
I said it three times.

01:30:06.317 --> 01:30:08.276
Um, but I'm mindful of it.

01:30:08.277 --> 01:30:10.362
I'm keeping count.
It's not every other word.

01:30:10.363 --> 01:30:12.656
Plus, we're in a casino.

01:30:14.158 --> 01:30:17.953
Okay. No one loses their ass
and says, "Aw, shucks." No.

01:30:19.831 --> 01:30:21.581
I heard some of you cussing before.

01:30:21.582 --> 01:30:25.293
"When the fuck is this gonna start?"
Yeah, I heard you. I heard you.

01:30:25.294 --> 01:30:26.586
I'm fat, not deaf.

01:30:26.587 --> 01:30:28.089
I heard you, goddammit.

01:30:28.923 --> 01:30:30.508
So anyway,

01:30:31.634 --> 01:30:33.261
he gives me this advice.

01:30:34.679 --> 01:30:38.432
Cut the cussing out of your show,
take out the filthy material.

01:30:38.433 --> 01:30:44.396
And I don't know why I listen,
but I did, and he was absolutely right.

01:30:44.397 --> 01:30:47.899
All of a sudden, I started getting
opportunities left and right.

01:30:47.900 --> 01:30:53.488
I started getting booked at colleges,
high schools, churches, fairs.

01:30:53.489 --> 01:30:54.991
And then the big one,

01:30:55.867 --> 01:30:57.117
casinos.

01:31:04.333 --> 01:31:05.542
Back in the day,

01:31:05.543 --> 01:31:09.588
you had to be squeaky-clean
to perform at a casino.

01:31:09.589 --> 01:31:11.798
Uh, but that's not the case anymore.

01:31:11.799 --> 01:31:14.509
If you can sell tickets,
it doesn't matter what you do,

01:31:14.510 --> 01:31:16.052
they want to book you.

01:31:16.053 --> 01:31:19.556
But back in the day, there was
only a few people who could pull it off.

01:31:19.557 --> 01:31:24.102
I was fortunate to be one of those people.
So I remember, I got booked to perform

01:31:24.103 --> 01:31:27.481
at a casino called Morongo
in Southern California,

01:31:27.482 --> 01:31:29.733
and I'm backstage with the booker,

01:31:29.734 --> 01:31:34.446
the lady that hired me for the function,
and she goes, "So, no cussing, right?"

01:31:34.447 --> 01:31:35.864
I go, "No. No cussing."

01:31:35.865 --> 01:31:38.742
"No filthy material?"
"No filthy material."

01:31:38.743 --> 01:31:39.910
"Good luck."

01:31:39.911 --> 01:31:43.997
And it was just me.
I didn't have openers. It was just me.

01:31:43.998 --> 01:31:46.958
It was a voice-over
on the frickin' speaker, right?

01:31:46.959 --> 01:31:50.253
"Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome
comedian, funny man Gabriel Iglesias."

01:31:50.254 --> 01:31:52.422
And then I just...
I walked out there, right?

01:31:52.423 --> 01:31:56.843
I offended the entire audience...

01:31:58.763 --> 01:32:00.640
...in five seconds.

01:32:01.891 --> 01:32:04.352
And I did it without cussing.

01:32:06.145 --> 01:32:11.567
Frickin' 22-year-old kid goes up on stage,
looks at the crowd and says,

01:32:12.068 --> 01:32:16.321
"Hey, everybody! Is this a regular casino,
or is this an Indian casino?"

01:32:20.743 --> 01:32:23.036
You see how you all know?

01:32:25.081 --> 01:32:26.123
I didn't know.

01:32:27.458 --> 01:32:30.877
I didn't know
because I didn't have TikTok to teach me.

01:32:32.463 --> 01:32:36.299
What I did have was a life experience
that I'll never forget.

01:32:36.300 --> 01:32:39.928
As soon as I said that,
the entire front row,

01:32:39.929 --> 01:32:44.058
which comprised of the tribal members
from the casino,

01:32:44.642 --> 01:32:46.601
they all stood up,

01:32:46.602 --> 01:32:49.604
and one of them called me out
in front of the entire audience.

01:32:49.605 --> 01:32:52.357
"Hey! Hey! You don't say that anymore!"

01:32:52.358 --> 01:32:54.442
"The proper term is Native American."

01:32:54.443 --> 01:32:55.986
"Please show respect."

01:32:55.987 --> 01:32:59.030
And I was like, "Oh my God.
I'm so sorry. I didn't know."

01:32:59.031 --> 01:33:02.368
And I felt horrible,
and I was so embarrassed.

01:33:02.994 --> 01:33:06.580
Fortunately, I had a second show
at ten o'clock. Ten o'clock hits.

01:33:06.581 --> 01:33:07.956
I take the stage.

01:33:07.957 --> 01:33:11.793
I didn't need to be told
a thousand times that I messed up.

01:33:11.794 --> 01:33:15.338
That one time of me getting shamed
in front of the entire audience

01:33:15.339 --> 01:33:16.881
was all I needed.

01:33:16.882 --> 01:33:19.509
That's why I'm a firm believer in shaming.

01:33:21.429 --> 01:33:23.431
I think shaming is good.

01:33:23.973 --> 01:33:28.519
Shaming is good as long
as you shame with purpose.

01:33:29.186 --> 01:33:32.522
If you're about to teach someone
a valuable lesson,

01:33:32.523 --> 01:33:35.358
I say go for it because it worked for me.

01:33:35.359 --> 01:33:37.235
I got shamed one time.

01:33:37.236 --> 01:33:40.947
Second show, ten o'clock.
I took the stage. Ooh, it was different.

01:33:40.948 --> 01:33:43.950
I was like, "Before I get started,
ladies and gentlemen,

01:33:43.951 --> 01:33:45.535
I'd like to take this opportunity

01:33:45.536 --> 01:33:48.830
to thank all of the Native Americans
who are here tonight."

01:33:48.831 --> 01:33:52.834
"Thank you for this opportunity
to perform in your casino."

01:33:52.835 --> 01:33:55.045
"I hope you enjoy the performance."

01:33:58.716 --> 01:34:00.258
I thought I was good.

01:34:00.259 --> 01:34:03.219
All of a sudden, another tribal member
in the back jumped up.

01:34:03.220 --> 01:34:07.265
And he's like, "Hey, drop the 'American'!
Just say 'Native'!"

01:34:10.936 --> 01:34:12.020
"'Kay!"

01:34:13.314 --> 01:34:15.315
That stayed with me. That was powerful.

01:34:15.316 --> 01:34:16.566
That was scary.

01:34:16.567 --> 01:34:19.027
Next time I did a casino,
first thing I said was,

01:34:19.028 --> 01:34:22.656
"I would like to acknowledge
all of the Natives who are here tonight,"

01:34:22.657 --> 01:34:25.826
and then someone yelled out,
"We're Indigenous!"

01:34:26.827 --> 01:34:28.287
Fuck me!

01:34:30.289 --> 01:34:31.498
That's four.

01:34:39.256 --> 01:34:43.843
With time, I got a chance to perform
all across the United States,

01:34:43.844 --> 01:34:47.097
and then I get
my first-ever show in Canada.

01:34:47.098 --> 01:34:48.432
Ironically enough,

01:34:49.016 --> 01:34:50.225
at a casino.

01:34:51.602 --> 01:34:53.478
It's a casino we still perform at

01:34:53.479 --> 01:34:56.231
called Caesars
in the city of Windsor, Ontario,

01:34:56.232 --> 01:34:58.983
right across the water
from Detroit, Michigan.

01:35:00.611 --> 01:35:04.197
I come to find out the hard way
that in Canada,

01:35:04.198 --> 01:35:10.453
it is a completely different term
for describing the... <i>people</i>...

01:35:11.872 --> 01:35:14.040
...originally from that land.

01:35:14.041 --> 01:35:16.627
The proper term in Canada is actually

01:35:17.169 --> 01:35:18.879
"First Nation."

01:35:19.422 --> 01:35:22.465
I didn't know that.
I was so nervous being in Canada,

01:35:22.466 --> 01:35:24.217
I said, "Native American."

01:35:26.095 --> 01:35:28.430
Like, "Hello?"
I'm not even in America, right?

01:35:28.431 --> 01:35:31.266
Frickin' stupid, right? <i>Pendejo</i>, I know.

01:35:32.935 --> 01:35:37.230
Fortunately, someone pulled me
to the side, and they told me what was up.

01:35:37.231 --> 01:35:39.232
I was lucky that I had a second show.

01:35:39.233 --> 01:35:42.402
Ten o'clock,
I take the stage, and I'm like,

01:35:42.403 --> 01:35:45.029
"Before I begin,
I would like to acknowledge

01:35:45.030 --> 01:35:48.032
all of the First Nation people
who are here tonight."

01:35:48.033 --> 01:35:51.286
Then some guy yells out,
"Call us Indians!"

01:35:57.084 --> 01:35:59.002
This guy in the front row was like...

01:35:59.003 --> 01:36:01.045
"They're not Indian."

01:36:10.014 --> 01:36:11.932
"They are not Indian!"

01:36:18.606 --> 01:36:20.858
Canada has always
been an adventure.

01:36:21.734 --> 01:36:25.195
There was one show that we did
at the same casino.

01:36:25.196 --> 01:36:29.949
Anytime now, we perform
outside of the United States,

01:36:29.950 --> 01:36:33.286
even if it's next door
in Canada or Mexico,

01:36:33.287 --> 01:36:36.873
Martin's first question
to the audience is,

01:36:36.874 --> 01:36:39.042
"Do we have any Americans
in the house tonight?"

01:36:39.043 --> 01:36:42.670
Because no matter where we perform
in the world, there's always a handful.

01:36:42.671 --> 01:36:46.716
So that night, Martin takes
the stage, and he asked the question,

01:36:46.717 --> 01:36:48.718
"Do we have any Americans here tonight?"

01:36:48.719 --> 01:36:52.388
Not knowing that earlier in the day,

01:36:52.389 --> 01:36:55.351
at that same casino,
in the grand ballroom,

01:36:55.976 --> 01:37:00.480
there was a... a end-of-year holiday party
from an American company

01:37:00.481 --> 01:37:03.066
from right across the water in Detroit.

01:37:03.067 --> 01:37:05.568
And they were having
this end-of-year celebration,

01:37:05.569 --> 01:37:08.988
and they were there,
pre-gaming since noon.

01:37:10.074 --> 01:37:11.199
Partying it up.

01:37:11.200 --> 01:37:14.369
And I guess the... the party planner
for the event

01:37:14.370 --> 01:37:20.208
thought it would be an amazing idea
to end their party with laughter.

01:37:20.209 --> 01:37:25.588
So this person bought all of the tickets
to my show that night

01:37:25.589 --> 01:37:27.757
and gave them to that company.

01:37:27.758 --> 01:37:31.387
Well, seven o'clock rolls around,
and everybody stumbles in,

01:37:31.887 --> 01:37:35.849
takes their seats, and then Martin
walks out, and he asked the question,

01:37:35.850 --> 01:37:37.267
"Do we have any Americans?"

01:37:37.268 --> 01:37:41.271
And instead of getting a "Yay,"
"Whoo," "Right here," he got...

01:37:43.691 --> 01:37:47.068
They were so drunk, they started chanting.

01:37:47.069 --> 01:37:53.658
"USA! USA! USA! USA!"

01:37:53.659 --> 01:37:57.453
I'm in the dressing room, hearing this.
I'm like, "Why are we here?"

01:37:58.831 --> 01:38:02.959
"We could have done this in Detroit."
You know? I had to fill out paperwork.

01:38:02.960 --> 01:38:04.587
I'm like, "This is not cool."

01:38:05.170 --> 01:38:07.714
So during intermission,
Martin comes backstage

01:38:07.715 --> 01:38:10.633
and he tells me,
"Bro, I don't know if you heard..."

01:38:10.634 --> 01:38:12.177
"Oh, I heard."

01:38:12.970 --> 01:38:15.597
"Might wanna mention it."
I go, "Oh, I will."

01:38:15.598 --> 01:38:19.475
So at some point during my performance,
I told the audience,

01:38:19.476 --> 01:38:22.228
"So, a little bird told me

01:38:22.229 --> 01:38:24.689
there might be
a couple of Americans here tonight."

01:38:24.690 --> 01:38:25.773
"Is that true?"

01:38:25.774 --> 01:38:26.941
Sure enough...

01:38:29.153 --> 01:38:31.237
And they started doing it again.

01:38:31.238 --> 01:38:35.658
"USA! USA! USA!"

01:38:35.659 --> 01:38:38.536
Then it got quiet,
and you could hear, "'Murica."

01:38:42.166 --> 01:38:46.085
I said, "Ladies and gentlemen,
do you understand what just happened?"

01:38:46.086 --> 01:38:47.879
"We just made history."

01:38:47.880 --> 01:38:51.341
And people in the front row, they're like,
"What are you talking about, history?"

01:38:51.342 --> 01:38:54.969
I said, "We just made history."

01:38:54.970 --> 01:38:58.765
"Who would have ever thought
you'd see the day

01:38:58.766 --> 01:39:05.313
where thousands upon thousands
upon thousands upon thousands

01:39:05.314 --> 01:39:10.568
of Americans would cross a border...

01:39:19.703 --> 01:39:21.747
...to see a Mexican?"

01:39:25.626 --> 01:39:32.216
Thank you for 27 years
of supporting this Mexican.

01:39:33.092 --> 01:39:36.344
Miami, I love you so much.
Many thanks.

01:39:36.345 --> 01:39:38.012
Have a good night!

01:39:38.013 --> 01:39:39.139
Thank you!
