you'd finally forget about Bella.

I'm sorry I didn't know.
Should've brought some blue balloons.

1:02:36.520 --> 1:02:38.320

We'll see.

You won't.

1:02:47.720 --> 1:02:49.520
Jake, I can do this.

- I'm strong enough.
- Come on.

You can spout that crap to your
bloodsucker, but you don't fool me.

1:02:58.960 --> 1:03:02.750
I can see what that thing's doing to you.
It's a killer, Bella.

1:03:03.440 --> 1:03:05.830
- You're wrong.
- And when you die,

1:03:06.520 --> 1:03:10.960
what was the point?
Of me loving you, you loving him.

1:03:11.040 --> 1:03:12.920
How is that right for anyone?

1:03:13.240 --> 1:03:14.830

Jacob, don't go.

1:03:53.920 --> 1:03:55.720
I know how this ends.

What? No, no, you're not.
You're not going to Switzerland.

It's really more of a spa.

1:21:37.480 --> 1:21:40.920
