WEBVTT

00:54.791 --> 00:55.750
There you go.

00:56.958 --> 00:58.666
I'll put this one here for now.

00:58.750 --> 01:01.083
There. Nice and tight.

01:01.166 --> 01:02.000
Franck?

01:02.500 --> 01:04.750
This is Stanislas.
He's replacing Dom this week.

01:04.833 --> 01:05.666
How are you?

01:07.166 --> 01:08.833
-Hi, welcome.
-Thanks.

01:09.416 --> 01:10.333
-Hi.
-Hi.

01:10.916 --> 01:12.666
I'll show you the anchoring points.

01:12.750 --> 01:13.583
Okay.

01:14.666 --> 01:15.625
Put this on.

01:17.083 --> 01:17.916
There we go.

01:20.291 --> 01:22.041
There. Okay.

01:28.125 --> 01:29.875
There's a little crack here.

01:32.125 --> 01:34.541
-Let me know if you need us to move.
-Okay.

01:34.625 --> 01:36.458
Just this crack here and we're done.

01:45.041 --> 01:45.916
Done.

01:59.208 --> 02:01.750
Sir. Can you come with me, please?

02:09.500 --> 02:10.416
Alright.

02:12.500 --> 02:13.750
Here we go.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.291
-Am I annoying you?
-Yeah, a little bit.

02:33.375 --> 02:34.375
-Hello.
-Hello.

02:34.458 --> 02:35.708
-Hello.
-Excuse me.

02:35.791 --> 02:37.208
-Here, give me a bag.
-No.

02:37.291 --> 02:38.875
I'm pregnant, I'm not sick.

02:38.958 --> 02:41.041
You're not sick, but it affects your mood.

02:41.125 --> 02:42.250
-Oh, really?
-Yes.

02:42.333 --> 02:43.791
-I swear.
-Sure.

03:06.083 --> 03:08.041
Fuck. Not this again.

03:14.166 --> 03:17.416
Twice in two weeks. And they don't
rob other apartments in the building.

03:17.500 --> 03:19.333
Last time, they only took your laptop.

03:19.416 --> 03:21.541
-What are they looking for?
-I don't know.

03:21.625 --> 03:22.458
You don't know?

03:24.833 --> 03:25.916
So, what do we do?

03:28.125 --> 03:30.291
-I'll go back to the police station.
-Sure.

03:31.416 --> 03:32.958
Go back to the police station.

03:47.583 --> 03:48.500
How are you?

03:50.583 --> 03:51.583
Good and you?

03:51.666 --> 03:53.666
-Coffee?
-Yeah, that'd be great. Thanks.

04:03.833 --> 04:06.500
-Did they find the key?
-I don't think so.

04:06.583 --> 04:09.875
-They didn't steal anything?
-No. It doesn't look like it.

04:10.791 --> 04:12.333
And Léo still doesn't know?

04:12.916 --> 04:15.541
With 15 days until the birth,
I don't want to tell her.

04:21.250 --> 04:23.083
I didn't think they'd go this far.

04:23.166 --> 04:25.000
I don't think you've seen anything yet.

04:30.000 --> 04:33.875
-There are a few others over there, Rémi.
-Look here. I'll take a photo for you.

04:33.958 --> 04:35.583
-Sure.
-Guys, time to go home.

04:35.666 --> 04:36.666
Let's go home.

04:38.500 --> 04:39.958
Copy that, Pascal.

04:40.041 --> 04:42.583
Let me know when you're done.
I'll send Rémi back up.

04:43.291 --> 04:44.500
Let's head back up.

04:53.541 --> 04:54.666
You okay, Franck?

04:56.458 --> 04:57.708
-All good.
-Hey!

04:57.791 --> 05:00.125
What's going on up there? Franck fell!

05:41.541 --> 05:45.291
Hi, you've reached Léo.
Leave me a message, I'll call you back.

05:55.458 --> 05:56.291
Franck!

05:58.875 --> 05:59.708
Franck!

06:18.333 --> 06:19.166
Léo!

06:20.791 --> 06:22.208
-Léo!
-Yeah?

06:22.708 --> 06:23.666
You okay?

06:24.625 --> 06:25.791
You tried to call me?

06:26.291 --> 06:27.125
Yeah.

06:27.708 --> 06:31.208
I wanted to know if… you needed anything.

06:38.041 --> 06:39.083
Did it go okay?

06:39.583 --> 06:40.416
Yeah.

06:44.166 --> 06:45.583
Want me to make you a coffee?

06:47.000 --> 06:48.291
No, thanks.

06:49.708 --> 06:51.291
I'm exhausted. I'm going to bed.

07:49.500 --> 07:50.666
I see the girl,

07:51.541 --> 07:53.458
and I don't even recognize her.

07:53.541 --> 07:55.500
Yeah, okay. We're going to…

07:55.583 --> 07:57.666
I thought that only guys…

08:22.708 --> 08:27.125
I'm… out at sea on my boat.

09:51.875 --> 09:53.208
What are you doing?

10:05.333 --> 10:08.916
Why are you doing this to me?
Do you think I need this shit?

10:09.416 --> 10:12.541
You don't sleep with me anymore.
You spend your nights on the roof.

10:12.625 --> 10:14.875
It's been shitty like this
my whole pregnancy.

10:15.875 --> 10:18.166
I support you, but I'm not an idiot.

10:19.375 --> 10:21.208
I don't say anything, but I'm not blind.

10:22.666 --> 10:23.958
Tell me what's going on.

11:32.375 --> 11:33.541
Léo!

11:41.291 --> 11:43.375
Don't touch her.

12:14.958 --> 12:16.375
Guys, you can stop now!

12:20.916 --> 12:23.625
Give us what we're looking for
or we'll continue.

12:24.583 --> 12:27.041
I'm warning you,
you won't like the second phase.

12:28.791 --> 12:30.666
You're gonna have to look a bit more.

12:31.375 --> 12:32.583
And take off your mask.

12:36.458 --> 12:37.625
I don't understand.

12:38.916 --> 12:40.375
Don't you want this child?

12:40.458 --> 12:42.541
This peaceful little life?

12:43.125 --> 12:44.625
What do you care about?

12:54.291 --> 12:56.458
You want to play the avenger, huh?

12:57.291 --> 12:58.541
To tell the truth.

13:00.041 --> 13:01.625
But you know, Franck,

13:02.125 --> 13:05.291
telling the truth
will never make your guilt go away.

13:05.375 --> 13:06.333
Your mistake.

13:11.416 --> 13:12.541
What a shame.

13:13.041 --> 13:14.500
What a tragedy.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.875
That this man,
who gave so much of himself to his work,

13:17.958 --> 13:23.541
ended up shooting his pregnant wife
in the head before taking his own life.

13:24.041 --> 13:25.250
And for what?

13:25.833 --> 13:26.750
Huh?

13:27.583 --> 13:29.666
Some will say he was too fragile.

13:30.291 --> 13:32.875
That he couldn't handle
the pressure, the lies,

13:33.958 --> 13:37.291
the death of his father,
the pattern repeating itself.

13:42.541 --> 13:45.666
Sometimes you have to know
when to let go, Franck.

13:46.916 --> 13:49.583
You'll die stubborn, but you will die.

13:53.625 --> 13:55.875
Alright, time to move on to phase two.

13:57.291 --> 13:58.708
Bring me the briefcase.

14:22.875 --> 14:24.041
(NO SIGNAL)

14:26.416 --> 14:27.250
Here.

14:29.875 --> 14:31.166
Take care of her.

14:35.375 --> 14:37.208
-Don't touch her!
-No!

14:37.291 --> 14:40.208
-Don't touch her!
-No!

14:40.291 --> 14:41.583
Don't touch her!

14:42.166 --> 14:43.291
What have you done?

14:44.000 --> 14:45.375
What have you done?

14:45.875 --> 14:46.708
No!

14:48.041 --> 14:49.250
Léo!

14:55.083 --> 14:56.458
Léo!

15:03.291 --> 15:05.416
Dear former officers, officers,

15:05.500 --> 15:08.416
non-commissioned officers,
2014 interns, and their families.

15:08.500 --> 15:10.291
GIGN HEADQUARTERS - 10 YEARS EARLIER

15:10.375 --> 15:13.041
This badge presentation ceremony
marks the completion

15:13.125 --> 15:15.500
of a long and difficult training program

15:16.000 --> 15:18.166
where you learned the fundamental values

15:18.250 --> 15:20.625
that make our tactical unit strong:

15:20.708 --> 15:23.750
commitment, challenging yourself,

15:23.833 --> 15:26.083
a spirit of solidarity and sacrifice,

15:26.166 --> 15:27.791
loyalty, and so much more.

15:28.375 --> 15:30.333
See this badge as a starting point

15:30.416 --> 15:32.208
rather than a conclusion.

15:32.291 --> 15:35.500
Take it as a symbol of your duty
to achieve excellence every day.

15:35.583 --> 15:38.458
Joining the GIGN is a lifetime commitment.

15:38.541 --> 15:41.625
Officers and non-commissioned officers
of 2014,

15:41.708 --> 15:45.208
your mentors will now present you
with your badge.

15:45.291 --> 15:47.666
You can wear it with dignity and pride.

15:52.458 --> 15:54.041
Gendarme Lazarev.

15:54.125 --> 15:55.291
Cliffhanger!

15:55.375 --> 15:57.291
-SpongeBob!
-Skinny cat!

16:03.041 --> 16:04.875
Wear it with dignity and pride.

16:05.833 --> 16:07.375
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

16:18.875 --> 16:20.041
Rejoin your forces!

16:32.000 --> 16:32.833
Excuse me.

16:34.583 --> 16:36.166
-Congrats, man.
-Congrats to you.

16:36.250 --> 16:37.833
We suffered, but we did it.

16:37.916 --> 16:40.375
I want to introduce you to someone.
Wait here. Manon?

16:40.958 --> 16:41.875
Bravo.

16:43.333 --> 16:45.083
-Hello.
-Manon, Franck.

16:45.166 --> 16:46.083
Franck.

16:46.166 --> 16:47.500
-Hello.
-Congratulations.

16:47.583 --> 16:49.208
How old are you? How old is he?

16:49.291 --> 16:51.541
-"I'm two." I'm kidding. He's two.
-Two.

16:53.041 --> 16:54.250
-Hello.
-My mom.

16:54.333 --> 16:55.500
-Hello.
-Hello.

16:55.583 --> 16:57.083
-Franck, Nico.
-Nice to meet you.

16:57.166 --> 16:59.375
-Congratulations to you too.
-Thank you.

16:59.458 --> 17:02.000
-I'm proud of my daughter.
-Yeah, it was really hard.

17:02.583 --> 17:04.166
-But it builds character.
-Yes.

17:04.250 --> 17:07.541
Well, I think she already has
quite a lot of that.

17:08.500 --> 17:10.083
-Have a good night. Thanks.
-Bye.

17:10.166 --> 17:13.125
If you need anything, it's the tradition.

17:13.208 --> 17:15.916
The wives of former officers
help the wives of the new ones.

17:16.000 --> 17:17.375
-Of course.
-No worries.

17:17.458 --> 17:18.583
-Okay.
-Our pleasure.

17:18.666 --> 17:20.500
-Thank you very much. Thanks.
-Of course.

17:21.083 --> 17:22.500
Congratulations.

17:22.583 --> 17:24.958
-I am happy to have you with us.
-Thanks.

17:25.041 --> 17:27.750
I heard you inherited
your father's climbing skills.

17:28.250 --> 17:30.166
We were lacking agility in the unit.

17:30.250 --> 17:31.833
Yeah, that's what they told me.

17:32.791 --> 17:36.333
And… I kept this.
It belonged to your father.

17:37.458 --> 17:39.666
I think he would have
liked you to have it.

17:51.375 --> 17:53.666
-He wrote this?
-Yes.

18:03.833 --> 18:04.666
Thanks.

18:34.166 --> 18:35.583
-Guard up!
-Shit.

18:42.000 --> 18:43.333
-Guard up.
-Yeah.

18:43.416 --> 18:44.583
One, two.

18:49.000 --> 18:50.166
The bastard's good.

18:50.250 --> 18:51.208
That's my Nico!

18:55.125 --> 18:56.583
Gendarmerie!

19:29.833 --> 19:31.833
-Nico?
-Yes, I'm here.

19:39.041 --> 19:40.500
Come on, in column formation.

19:48.625 --> 19:49.916
Shut up!

19:50.000 --> 19:52.625
Target in sight in the office
at the top of the stairs.

20:03.458 --> 20:04.916
Target hit.

20:05.000 --> 20:06.208
And removed.

20:09.708 --> 20:10.541
Here.

20:11.458 --> 20:12.666
Jacques?

20:12.750 --> 20:14.958
My name is Léonore. I'm a gendarme.

20:15.833 --> 20:19.000
You wanted to speak to a woman.
I'm listening to you.

20:19.083 --> 20:20.958
Very good, Jacques. Put your hands up!

20:21.041 --> 20:22.166
Put your arm up!

20:22.250 --> 20:24.958
Lie on the ground next to the railing.

20:25.708 --> 20:26.916
Very good, Jacques!

20:27.000 --> 20:28.875
It's almost over. Lie on the ground.

20:29.750 --> 20:32.416
I'm obligated to do this.
Okay? It's for safety.

20:33.583 --> 20:35.791
Please!

20:35.875 --> 20:36.750
Hey, man.

20:36.833 --> 20:40.041
I would like to raise a toast to Léo
for that excellent negotiation.

20:40.125 --> 20:41.833
-That's right!
-Super Léo!

20:43.750 --> 20:45.958
And I would also like to point out

20:46.041 --> 20:48.083
-that although there aren't many of us…
-Yeah.

20:48.166 --> 20:50.708
…since we apparently
don't have what it takes.

20:50.791 --> 20:51.708
Yeah!

20:51.791 --> 20:53.708
It's a good thing we have the heart,

20:53.791 --> 20:56.958
finesse, and delicacy
to help you guys negotiate.

20:59.625 --> 21:02.166
-To Léo!
-To Léo!

21:09.375 --> 21:11.625
It's the idiot
emptying his magazine again.

21:12.916 --> 21:14.625
Oh, he's going to pay for it.

21:15.791 --> 21:16.666
Well done.

21:17.708 --> 21:18.583
Thanks.

21:27.916 --> 21:29.333
So what do we do? Do we kiss?

21:32.833 --> 21:35.708
-Come on, stop.
-I don't know. Should I take your hand?

21:36.333 --> 21:38.416
-I can't touch you?
-No, don't touch me.

21:38.500 --> 21:39.458
Franck for Nico.

21:39.541 --> 21:41.583
They're walking to the parking lot.

21:41.666 --> 21:43.666
-You're on, my friends.
-Copy that.

21:57.208 --> 21:59.416
-There you go. You're coming around.
-Shut up.

22:07.458 --> 22:08.333
They're coming.

22:10.458 --> 22:12.083
It's in your bag, isn't it?

22:14.250 --> 22:15.625
Did you look in your pockets?

22:17.750 --> 22:20.166
-Go ahead. She's lost her ticket again.
-Okay.

22:22.041 --> 22:23.375
Did you check your pockets?

22:25.541 --> 22:27.500
-Don't move!
-Fuck!

22:27.583 --> 22:28.750
Give me your hands!

22:29.541 --> 22:31.125
Stop, damn it!

22:31.708 --> 22:33.541
-Stop!
-Don't move!

22:33.625 --> 22:35.875
-Let me go, damn it! Please!
-Shut up.

22:35.958 --> 22:38.125
-It won't hurt if you don't move.
-Shut it.

22:38.208 --> 22:39.958
Ouch, he's squeezing me hard!

22:40.041 --> 22:43.750
Hey, interns! Get moving, or I'll fire you
before the end of the week.

22:44.750 --> 22:47.041
We don't have all day!

22:47.125 --> 22:48.583
Should I wait for you or what?

22:48.666 --> 22:50.041
You put it inside out.

22:51.208 --> 22:52.916
Come on, climb!

22:53.416 --> 22:54.250
Come on.

22:55.583 --> 22:58.541
Hey, guys, did you skip breakfast or what?

22:58.625 --> 23:01.041
Hey, Lauga. You're starting
to get on my nerves.

23:01.125 --> 23:03.375
We'll see if you're a smart ass
up on the beam.

23:03.458 --> 23:05.583
-Yes, Sergeant.
-Come with me.

23:06.166 --> 23:07.375
Come on, move forward.

23:08.416 --> 23:11.250
-To the end?
-Yes. We'll see how you feel then.

23:11.333 --> 23:12.458
-Come on!
-Alright.

23:12.541 --> 23:14.166
Show them what you've got, Ben!

23:16.541 --> 23:17.833
Hey, Spider-Man.

23:17.916 --> 23:19.583
-We don't have all day.
-Come on!

23:19.666 --> 23:21.375
-He's pretty good, huh?
-Come on.

23:21.458 --> 23:23.083
-Come on!
-That made you shut up.

23:24.041 --> 23:26.458
-Come on!
-Isn't his carabiner getting a bit loose?

23:30.541 --> 23:32.750
Hey, little shit. Watch the wind!

23:33.666 --> 23:34.750
Can I run my mouth now?

23:36.875 --> 23:38.916
Nico's not bad! I want him with us.

23:39.000 --> 23:40.083
Yeah, I'd keep him too.

23:40.166 --> 23:42.083
-We want him too.
-Alright. We're off.

23:42.166 --> 23:43.166
Okay, come down!

23:43.250 --> 23:44.500
Let's go.

23:49.791 --> 23:50.791
Okay, back to work.

23:51.833 --> 23:53.208
Okay, come back down.

23:56.625 --> 23:58.583
Come on, stand up! Gloves up!

23:58.666 --> 23:59.500
Come on!

24:00.416 --> 24:01.250
Come on!

24:02.000 --> 24:03.250
-Come on!
-That's good.

24:04.666 --> 24:06.750
Come on! Guard up!

24:07.375 --> 24:10.541
Come on. Protect yourself.
Don't turn your back! Stand up.

24:13.375 --> 24:14.625
Why are you on your own?

24:14.708 --> 24:17.125
I don't have a jockstrap.
I can't find my size.

24:17.208 --> 24:19.583
I see, you're a comedian.
Wait, stay there.

24:19.666 --> 24:22.958
Bruno, come take that smile off his face.
He's getting on my nerves.

24:23.041 --> 24:24.250
I like this guy.

24:24.333 --> 24:26.083
-With him?
-Yes, go on, show us.

24:26.166 --> 24:28.458
-Go, Bruno! Come on, Bruno!
-That's it.

24:30.791 --> 24:32.916
That's it. Come on, Bruno! Kick!

24:39.083 --> 24:40.416
Hang in there, come on!

24:43.416 --> 24:44.458
-Go, Bruno!
-Go, Ben!

24:44.541 --> 24:46.541
Come on, get him!

24:48.541 --> 24:49.750
Come on!

24:55.875 --> 24:57.958
Come on. Go!

24:59.458 --> 25:00.291
Get up!

25:00.375 --> 25:01.458
Come on!

25:09.166 --> 25:10.291
Well done.

25:11.333 --> 25:12.208
Hey.

25:12.291 --> 25:13.291
Okay, that's good.

25:14.500 --> 25:17.166
That's good. Good job, kiddo.

25:54.791 --> 25:55.791
Welcome.

26:00.125 --> 26:01.791
Wear it with dignity and pride.

26:13.583 --> 26:15.250
-How are you?
-Congratulations.

26:15.750 --> 26:16.750
Yeah!

26:16.833 --> 26:18.041
Yes, go ahead!

26:18.666 --> 26:20.625
-Where will you put it?
-Stick it here?

26:22.375 --> 26:24.166
-Yeah.
-There you go.

26:24.666 --> 26:27.541
-How are you? Are you settled in?
-Yes, we're lucky.

26:27.625 --> 26:29.458
Just a few things and we'll be done.

26:29.541 --> 26:31.291
-How many bedrooms?
-Three.

26:32.500 --> 26:34.458
That's true. It's not the same thing.

26:39.416 --> 26:43.041
I live for her, day after day

26:43.125 --> 26:46.500
When her chords melt inside of me

26:46.583 --> 26:50.000
She's my most beautiful love story

26:50.083 --> 26:53.750
It's a first that never hurts

26:53.833 --> 26:57.000
I live for her, she makes me

26:57.083 --> 26:59.125
Travel from city to city

26:59.208 --> 27:01.666
We don't have to talk about it, but…

27:02.958 --> 27:07.500
I felt sad today
that on a day like this you're all alone.

27:11.458 --> 27:13.125
I mean, you know when you're…

27:13.625 --> 27:16.291
When you're a little Arab kid,
your name is Benjamin,

27:16.375 --> 27:19.000
and you grow up
in a small village in the Jura,

27:19.083 --> 27:21.500
believe me, it's not super easy
to make friends.

27:23.125 --> 27:25.375
And I lost both of my parents
seven years ago.

27:25.875 --> 27:28.666
They were already pretty old
when they adopted me,

27:28.750 --> 27:31.666
and my mom passed away
not long after my father.

27:32.416 --> 27:33.625
There you go.

27:33.708 --> 27:35.833
I've officially ruined the vibe.

27:37.250 --> 27:39.500
You've never wondered
who your real parents were?

27:39.583 --> 27:41.000
They were my real parents.

27:41.083 --> 27:44.333
I've never been my mom's priority,
so why should she be mine?

27:45.583 --> 27:46.541
Simple as that.

27:47.666 --> 27:49.375
-Okay.
-Okay? All good?

27:51.208 --> 27:52.083
Cheers.

27:54.125 --> 27:56.291
I live for her

27:56.375 --> 27:57.875
That's terrible!

28:00.750 --> 28:03.375
I live for her

28:03.875 --> 28:05.541
She's you and me

28:05.625 --> 28:08.416
She's you and me

28:08.500 --> 28:14.208
I live for her

28:16.416 --> 28:21.041
I live for her

28:29.500 --> 28:30.333
Yeah!

28:54.750 --> 28:56.666
The techniques you told me about,

28:56.750 --> 28:58.416
they must really help with the…

28:58.500 --> 29:00.291
-Yeah, but…
-I mean, to…

29:00.791 --> 29:03.500
to figure out
the people you're talking to.

29:04.458 --> 29:06.791
I've been telling you
about this for an hour.

29:07.500 --> 29:09.583
I wanted to let you know
that I understood.

29:10.083 --> 29:12.041
-What did you understand?
-That it must be…

29:12.125 --> 29:15.083
I mean, that it was super interesting. To…

29:15.583 --> 29:18.333
-To figure out…
-It's very interesting.

29:19.333 --> 29:22.625
It helps you determine pretty quickly
who you're dealing with.

29:23.416 --> 29:24.291
Oh, really?

29:24.791 --> 29:27.083
So, I imagine
that after two years of knowing me…

29:28.041 --> 29:31.041
-You must have me all figured out.
-It only took me ten minutes.

29:31.750 --> 29:34.125
Is that so? Was it that obvious?

29:34.208 --> 29:35.083
Very.

29:40.083 --> 29:42.250
Are we going to talk about work all night?

29:42.333 --> 29:46.041
Ah… I didn't want to say it,
because you've been boring me for an hour

29:46.125 --> 29:47.875
with your crappy technique stories.

29:48.375 --> 29:50.750
I've been hoping we'd hook up
for the last two years.

29:54.458 --> 29:56.666
Oh, shit, so much lost time!

29:59.375 --> 30:00.500
That's so stupid.

30:01.000 --> 30:03.375
You mean hooking up with each other?

30:04.166 --> 30:05.416
Oh, really! Shit!

30:07.666 --> 30:09.416
We've got a lot of catching up to do.

30:19.708 --> 30:21.041
-Oh, sorry.
-For fuck's sake.

30:21.125 --> 30:22.250
Go on, get out of here!

30:22.958 --> 30:23.791
Oh!

30:23.875 --> 30:24.875
For fuck's sake.

30:25.958 --> 30:27.750
-What's…
-Well, he's sick.

30:27.833 --> 30:30.750
-The idiot can't hold his alcohol.
-Wait, you and Léo?

30:30.833 --> 30:32.208
-No…
-No way!

30:32.291 --> 30:34.541
-Look, he's sick!
-No way!

30:35.041 --> 30:36.166
Seems like we're going…

30:36.250 --> 30:37.541
-Where's Ben?
-He's pathetic.

30:37.625 --> 30:40.791
Ben? Ben is in the car.
He's been throwing up everywhere.

30:41.375 --> 30:43.166
-You don't want to see it.
-The puker.

30:43.250 --> 30:44.125
What a night.

30:44.750 --> 30:46.041
Sweet dreams.

30:46.125 --> 30:47.291
Oh, he's here!

30:48.125 --> 30:49.000
He's here.

30:49.083 --> 30:51.291
-Say goodbye.
-Bye, everyone!

30:51.375 --> 30:53.666
-Bye!
-I didn't say goodbye to Laurent.

30:53.750 --> 30:55.250
-Bye, team!
-Later!

30:55.333 --> 30:56.916
Your girl's a real trooper.

30:57.000 --> 30:58.166
I know, right?

30:58.666 --> 31:01.250
Eight months pregnant,
dancing until six in the morning.

31:01.333 --> 31:03.166
Yeah, but I'm starting to feel it now.

31:03.750 --> 31:04.833
Alright, good night.

31:05.708 --> 31:06.833
It was a good night.

31:06.916 --> 31:08.208
It was perfect.

31:08.291 --> 31:09.541
Alright, good night.

31:10.666 --> 31:11.500
Sleep tight.

31:12.541 --> 31:13.541
You're so stupid!

31:13.625 --> 31:15.000
-I'm going to bed now.
-Yeah?

31:15.083 --> 31:17.125
I'm tired, do you get that? I'm dead.

31:17.208 --> 31:18.291
-Hey!
-Yeah.

31:18.375 --> 31:20.291
-Hey! Are you gonna meet up with her?
-No!

31:20.375 --> 31:21.750
-Stop.
-You're gonna fuck.

31:21.833 --> 31:24.291
-We're not gonna fuck at all.
-Come on, stop it.

31:24.375 --> 31:26.708
It's about time I gave birth.
You're out of control.

31:26.791 --> 31:29.416
Hey! I had never really spoken
with that woman before.

31:29.500 --> 31:32.333
-Oh, yeah?
-But when you take the time to have a…

31:32.833 --> 31:34.833
-Stop it.
-But, no, I'm serious.

31:34.916 --> 31:36.458
-Alright. Go on.
-I'm serious.

31:36.541 --> 31:39.750
When you take the time
to have a real conversation with her,

31:39.833 --> 31:41.458
that chick, she's actually amazing.

31:41.541 --> 31:43.416
-Amazing?
-Amazing.

31:43.500 --> 31:45.333
She's chic. She dazzles.

31:45.416 --> 31:46.666
She's dazzling.

31:46.750 --> 31:48.750
-Stunning.
-You're annoying.

31:48.833 --> 31:50.083
-Go on.
-Good night.

31:50.166 --> 31:52.666
-Have a refreshing sleep. It's important.
-Yeah.

31:52.750 --> 31:54.500
-Alright, good night.
-Bye.

32:15.791 --> 32:17.875
-Oh, the little bastard!
-Fuck, you're…

32:20.291 --> 32:21.458
Where are we going?

32:21.541 --> 32:24.500
-Fuck. You're so annoying.
-Huh?

32:24.583 --> 32:26.791
-Are we going for a walk?
-Yes.

32:26.875 --> 32:28.666
I need some fresh air.

32:28.750 --> 32:31.083
Come on, leave me alone. For fuck's sake!

32:31.166 --> 32:33.750
What are you going to talk about now?
Crisis management?

32:33.833 --> 32:35.083
The psych unit!

32:38.250 --> 32:39.500
He's so sneaky!

33:14.958 --> 33:16.250
There you go.

33:16.916 --> 33:18.583
-Is it cooked?
-Yeah.

33:18.666 --> 33:21.458
So what, we don't care
about the general today?

33:21.541 --> 33:22.375
What about me?

33:22.458 --> 33:24.458
There's no respect anymore.

33:25.083 --> 33:26.166
Wow, that looks good.

33:36.916 --> 33:38.916
That's my boy! That's right, guys.

33:39.000 --> 33:41.416
Come on, pull!

33:50.833 --> 33:51.791
Come on, honey!

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
Yeah!

34:06.833 --> 34:08.041
You're such a cheater.

34:08.125 --> 34:10.875
-You can't let them win, huh?
-He's always cheating.

34:10.958 --> 34:12.000
I let him win.

34:12.083 --> 34:13.541
-I let him win.
-He came second.

34:13.625 --> 34:15.208
Was there a false start or what?

34:15.291 --> 34:16.583
He's a sore loser.

34:17.166 --> 34:19.000
We're the champions.

34:19.083 --> 34:21.541
Like father, like son.
You're a generation of cheaters.

34:21.625 --> 34:23.541
A new generation of cheaters.

34:23.625 --> 34:25.166
You're all accomplices.

34:25.250 --> 34:27.125
Don't worry. Check this out.

34:30.541 --> 34:33.208
Look at these little piggies!

34:33.750 --> 34:36.708
-Francky, you know what you need to do.
-Are you out of your mind?

34:37.500 --> 34:40.666
You think I've worked so hard
just to go and have a child now?

34:40.750 --> 34:42.083
There, in your face.

34:43.000 --> 34:45.875
I really love children
when they belong to someone else.

34:50.000 --> 34:52.458
Being a godfather suits me.
I'd be a great godfather.

34:52.958 --> 34:54.833
-You'd make a beautiful baby.
-Okay, guys.

34:54.916 --> 34:56.166
With sultry eyes.

34:56.250 --> 34:57.375
And little bangs.

34:59.083 --> 35:00.250
Some little bangs.

35:00.333 --> 35:01.666
Who wants a beer?

35:01.750 --> 35:03.208
-I'd like one.
-I'm good.

35:03.291 --> 35:04.666
Some apple juice.

35:04.750 --> 35:07.666
Oh, you lost your pacifier.

35:10.291 --> 35:12.541
I think your reasoning
is completely stupid.

35:13.541 --> 35:15.541
You can't claim things like that.

35:15.625 --> 35:18.458
What do you want me to say?
I'm completely stupid then.

35:18.958 --> 35:21.791
Do you know what it's like
to lose your father at eight?

35:22.291 --> 35:23.916
That's how your life's gonna be?

35:24.458 --> 35:27.458
You won't build anything
because you're afraid?

35:27.541 --> 35:28.708
It's sad, no?

35:28.791 --> 35:31.291
You want to end up
like some of the guys in the group

35:31.375 --> 35:34.291
who work out at 11 p.m.
because they have no one at home?

35:34.375 --> 35:37.125
What do you mean "no one"?
She doesn't want children either.

35:37.625 --> 35:41.166
Why are you bugging me? Just because
you're rabbits doesn't mean we have to be.

35:41.250 --> 35:43.708
I'm sure you and Léo
will be great parents.

35:43.791 --> 35:45.541
Stop it!

35:46.375 --> 35:49.083
-But she's right, man.
-Are you going to start now too?

35:49.166 --> 35:51.791
We can't do what we do
if we don't have a foundation.

35:51.875 --> 35:52.791
It's not possible.

35:52.875 --> 35:55.375
You can't go into action
without a family at home,

35:55.458 --> 35:56.791
without a cool head.

35:56.875 --> 35:59.333
If you're detached,
then what do you become?

35:59.416 --> 36:02.458
You become a hothead,
a danger to yourself and the group.

36:04.041 --> 36:06.333
You think it'll make you weaker,
but it doesn't.

36:06.416 --> 36:08.666
You have no idea
the strength it gives you.

36:08.750 --> 36:10.000
It's there in the morning.

36:10.083 --> 36:12.208
So, you'll leave your kids in the lurch?

36:12.291 --> 36:14.500
Are you gonna live in fear? It helps you.

36:15.125 --> 36:18.250
-I'm not trying to annoy you. I'm just…
-You're not annoying me.

36:18.333 --> 36:21.333
Without Manon or the kids,
I wouldn't be where I am now.

36:23.375 --> 36:25.416
Even though sometimes
she gets on my nerves.

36:26.208 --> 36:28.666
-He's a pain!
-I ruined it.

36:28.750 --> 36:30.875
-You ruined it. It was perfect.
-I'm kidding.

36:30.958 --> 36:31.958
Seriously.

36:35.291 --> 36:37.666
9 YEARS LATER

36:39.125 --> 36:41.583
Come on, Nico.
Where are you going on vacation?

36:41.666 --> 36:44.666
-I'm not telling. It's a family trip.
-Just send the location.

36:44.750 --> 36:46.375
-No!
-Where is it, in Thailand?

36:46.458 --> 36:47.500
I'm not telling you.

36:48.000 --> 36:49.458
He's scared we'll show up.

36:49.541 --> 36:52.166
No, I just want to have
some peace and quiet.

36:52.875 --> 36:53.750
Hello?

36:53.833 --> 36:56.250
Hello? When are you coming home?

36:56.333 --> 36:59.250
We just finished a training session.
We'll be in Versailles soon.

36:59.333 --> 37:01.458
We'll be there in five minutes.
Everything ok?

37:01.541 --> 37:02.708
Yes, everything's fine.

37:05.041 --> 37:08.333
-But I wanted to tell you that…
-Wait, I have another call.

37:08.416 --> 37:11.208
We'll be there soon anyway.
Okay? See you soon.

37:12.375 --> 37:13.625
-Yes, Éric?
-Yes, Franck?

37:13.708 --> 37:15.291
I'm at work, at the hotel.

37:15.875 --> 37:17.875
There were gunshots in one of the rooms.

37:19.333 --> 37:23.166
-Did you call the police?
-It just happened, so I called you.

37:23.750 --> 37:27.166
Listen, I'll make a call
to see if we can step in, but…

37:27.250 --> 37:29.666
You know what?
We're not far away, so we'll come by.

37:29.750 --> 37:31.833
-Nobody goes up there. We're on our way.
-Okay.

37:31.916 --> 37:32.958
See you soon.

37:33.041 --> 37:34.125
What's wrong?

37:34.208 --> 37:36.708
There were gunshots
in one of the rooms at the Trianon.

37:37.791 --> 37:40.958
We're stopping at the Trianon hotel.
There's been a shooting.

37:41.041 --> 37:43.250
-See you soon.
-Alright, here we go.

38:04.000 --> 38:05.958
Yes, General. We've just arrived.

38:06.041 --> 38:08.000
We can be operational in five minutes.

38:10.125 --> 38:11.416
Absolutely. Copy that.

38:12.041 --> 38:15.208
Just bring what you can holster.
I'd like to gather some information.

38:16.583 --> 38:18.250
Gear up, guys.

38:18.333 --> 38:20.625
We're not intervening.
We're waiting for backup.

38:20.708 --> 38:21.708
-Copy that.
-Okay.

38:21.791 --> 38:22.791
I'll be back.

38:25.041 --> 38:25.875
Franck.

38:25.958 --> 38:27.791
-How are you?
-Good. Thanks for coming.

38:27.875 --> 38:30.208
-Is your manager here?
-He's in the lobby.

38:39.458 --> 38:42.750
-Hello, I'm the manager of the hotel.
-Can you summarize the situation?

38:42.833 --> 38:46.125
Some clients heard gunshots.
We called the police, but I believe--

38:46.208 --> 38:47.291
Nico, the stairs.

38:48.083 --> 38:48.916
And your friend…

38:49.000 --> 38:51.458
-Sir, please!
-…gave you a call.

39:18.166 --> 39:19.333
Come here.

39:21.791 --> 39:23.791
Break!

39:24.791 --> 39:26.708
Urgent! Call an ambulance!

39:26.791 --> 39:27.875
Two men down!

39:27.958 --> 39:30.791
I repeat! Two men down! Call an ambulance!

39:35.833 --> 39:36.833
Fuck.

39:40.833 --> 39:42.791
Breathe.

39:43.666 --> 39:44.791
Nico.

39:44.875 --> 39:46.083
Nico!

39:46.166 --> 39:48.291
Come on. Breathe, Nico.

39:49.083 --> 39:49.958
Breathe.

39:56.250 --> 39:57.208
Hang in there.

39:59.708 --> 40:00.750
Nico!

40:06.416 --> 40:07.500
Fuck.

40:12.125 --> 40:13.250
Fuck.

40:13.875 --> 40:14.958
Fuck.

40:16.458 --> 40:17.666
Fuck, Nico.

40:29.000 --> 40:32.458
I'm sorry to bother you with this,
but I'll need your weapon and your vest.

40:49.333 --> 40:50.208
Thank you.

40:54.333 --> 40:55.708
Alright, let's move.

41:01.958 --> 41:03.041
How are you doing?

41:04.541 --> 41:05.458
Fine.

41:09.625 --> 41:11.666
How long were you in custody?

41:12.208 --> 41:13.250
Twenty-four hours.

41:15.708 --> 41:18.250
-I told you not to intervene.
-We didn't, Sylvain.

41:18.750 --> 41:21.166
I wanted information.
The guys showed up in the lobby.

41:21.250 --> 41:22.916
You were not to enter that lobby.

41:23.000 --> 41:25.666
If they hadn't seen you,
they might've left quietly.

41:25.750 --> 41:27.583
Is my job to pretend not to see them?

41:27.666 --> 41:30.041
No, your job is to follow my orders.

41:30.708 --> 41:34.166
You wanted to go on your own.
Now we're all in deep shit.

41:34.250 --> 41:37.000
You had two men,
who were your responsibility,

41:37.083 --> 41:40.708
enter a potentially dangerous situation,
without protection. So irresponsible.

41:40.791 --> 41:42.583
I couldn't know they'd show up.

41:42.666 --> 41:45.291
We've taught you to anticipate everything!

41:53.041 --> 41:55.333
I know how close you and Nico were.

41:56.791 --> 41:58.666
It's a huge loss for all of us.

42:01.250 --> 42:04.458
I could never have imagined
I'd have to do something like this.

42:04.958 --> 42:06.291
But I don't have a choice.

42:08.166 --> 42:10.875
I have to ask you to leave the group.

42:13.833 --> 42:15.458
You betrayed my trust.

42:17.625 --> 42:21.083
And you know very well
that trust is the foundation of our unit.

42:24.416 --> 42:27.250
I'd like you to know
that Ben had nothing to do with it.

42:28.125 --> 42:30.041
I take full responsibility.

42:31.041 --> 42:33.583
We are not considering firing Benjamin.

44:22.458 --> 44:23.458
Forgive me.

44:25.083 --> 44:26.250
It's all my fault.

44:58.791 --> 45:01.125
Go away!

45:01.208 --> 45:02.333
Mom, help me!

45:02.416 --> 45:03.958
He's the one bothering me!

45:04.041 --> 45:06.833
He keeps coming into my room.
I want to be alone!

45:07.916 --> 45:10.500
-I want to be alone!
-I want Dad!

45:19.458 --> 45:20.708
Do you want some help?

45:24.291 --> 45:25.250
Yeah.

45:29.500 --> 45:30.583
I'm…

45:30.666 --> 45:32.875
I'm gonna go for a walk.
I need to get out.

45:48.375 --> 45:49.708
Goddamn.

46:01.208 --> 46:03.208
Nico, you were an amazing father.

46:03.833 --> 46:05.166
A wonderful husband.

46:06.708 --> 46:08.875
You left too quickly, too soon.

46:08.958 --> 46:10.708
But you left as a hero.

46:12.666 --> 46:16.958
Your bravery, loyalty, and kindness

46:17.041 --> 46:19.583
are the things you would have wanted
to be remembered for.

46:20.166 --> 46:22.083
You wouldn't have wanted our pity.

46:23.083 --> 46:24.041
So, for you,

46:24.916 --> 46:27.166
we'll find the strength to keep going.

46:28.416 --> 46:30.708
Holding onto the best of who you were.

46:45.333 --> 46:48.625
If you ever you want to talk to me,
tell your mom. She'll call me.

46:48.708 --> 46:50.708
-And we'll talk, okay?
-Okay.

46:51.250 --> 46:52.125
Alright.

46:59.750 --> 47:02.125
I don't understand.
Hasn't it always been your dream?

47:02.208 --> 47:04.625
You've never said
you wanted to leave the group.

47:05.458 --> 47:08.166
-It has nothing to do with you.
-Why then?

47:10.500 --> 47:11.375
For us.

47:23.375 --> 47:24.666
What do you mean, "For us"?

47:29.458 --> 47:30.291
Us.

47:32.958 --> 47:34.541
Our life, together.

47:34.625 --> 47:36.833
What we can build together.

47:36.916 --> 47:38.166
It might be a sign.

47:38.250 --> 47:40.583
A sign of what?
I don't want to build anything.

47:41.291 --> 47:45.208
You want us to get shitty little jobs
to live a shitty little life

47:45.291 --> 47:48.791
in a house that we'll finish paying off
when it's about time for us to die?

47:48.875 --> 47:50.541
That wasn't gonna be our life, Léo.

47:53.291 --> 47:54.958
That wasn't it. I'm sorry.

48:00.750 --> 48:02.083
It was around 8 p.m.

48:02.166 --> 48:04.250
that the GIGN unit arrived at the scene

48:04.333 --> 48:07.583
and crossed paths
with the two individuals in the lobby.

48:07.666 --> 48:11.041
This exchange of fire unfortunately
led to the death of the two robbers

48:11.125 --> 48:14.541
and the death of one of the GIGN members
who was about to intervene.

48:14.625 --> 48:17.750
So, were the two burglars,
known to the police,

48:17.833 --> 48:19.583
caught in the act of larceny?

48:19.666 --> 48:21.125
We're still awaiting the…

48:26.250 --> 48:27.708
Did you hear that nonsense?

48:27.791 --> 48:30.375
They want us to think
those guys were burglars?

48:30.458 --> 48:32.375
Burglars who shoot and fight like that?

48:32.458 --> 48:34.041
Don't you think something's off?

48:39.041 --> 48:40.750
What did they say about your knee?

48:40.833 --> 48:43.458
-They said it's not looking good.
-What do you mean?

48:44.833 --> 48:45.958
I won't be staying.

48:46.458 --> 48:47.375
You're joking.

48:47.458 --> 48:50.166
Based on the MRI,
they think there will be permanent damage.

48:50.250 --> 48:52.250
And I won't be able to put pressure on it.

48:52.833 --> 48:54.916
They've offered me an administrative job,

48:55.416 --> 48:58.791
but if it's doing paperwork all day,
I prefer to leave.

49:02.208 --> 49:05.958
-Ben, I'm so sorry. All of it is my--
-Franck, let's get one thing straight.

49:07.000 --> 49:09.291
Never talk to me
about how you were responsible.

49:10.583 --> 49:14.166
If I thought we were making a mistake,
I would've told you before we went in.

49:14.958 --> 49:16.875
We did our duty. End of story.

49:44.458 --> 49:45.291
Over here.

49:52.583 --> 49:54.166
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

50:07.375 --> 50:08.291
I'm pregnant.

50:31.541 --> 50:32.416
But I…

50:37.375 --> 50:38.875
I thought you didn't want that.

50:40.500 --> 50:42.250
Yeah, I thought that too.

50:47.625 --> 50:48.458
But…

50:48.958 --> 50:50.333
I want this child.

51:19.583 --> 51:20.916
Excuse me for two minutes.

51:41.250 --> 51:43.625
So, yes, there is no elevator,

51:43.708 --> 51:46.541
but you have the benefit
of being on the top floor

51:46.625 --> 51:48.583
and having great natural light.

51:51.333 --> 51:52.708
What do you think?

51:55.541 --> 51:57.000
I think it's nice.

52:24.000 --> 52:27.250
NATIONAL GENDARMERIE INTERVENTION GROUP

52:44.291 --> 52:46.750
IRCGN - FORENSIC SCIENCE INSTITUTE
NATIONAL GENDARMERIE

52:50.041 --> 52:52.541
This is the badge,
and here are the test results.

52:52.625 --> 52:54.208
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

52:54.291 --> 52:57.583
Don't tell anyone you had this done here.
This is nothing but trouble.

52:59.291 --> 53:01.416
Okay. Thanks.

53:04.291 --> 53:07.375
Salim Lakdaoui.
Former member of the Special Forces.

53:08.000 --> 53:09.833
He works for the DGSI.

53:10.583 --> 53:12.875
He goes from ministry to ministry
doing jobs.

53:12.958 --> 53:16.125
Clearly, the two guys killed
in the room weren't tourists.

53:17.166 --> 53:19.916
-Shit, this is serious.
-Seems like it, yeah.

53:20.875 --> 53:22.958
If you want my advice, stay out of it.

54:03.458 --> 54:04.375
Are you ready?

54:06.875 --> 54:09.333
You keep your eyes closed tight, Lulu.

54:15.125 --> 54:17.416
Surprise!

54:17.500 --> 54:19.333
-Happy birthday.
-Thanks.

54:20.875 --> 54:23.208
-Happy birthday.
-Happy birthday, sweetie.

54:23.708 --> 54:25.416
-All good?
-Yeah.

54:29.583 --> 54:30.833
You look gorgeous.

54:34.250 --> 54:36.125
-Is that the one you wanted?
-Yeah.

54:36.208 --> 54:38.166
Franck and Léo
helped me with the surprise.

54:38.250 --> 54:39.416
Go for it, sweetie.

54:39.916 --> 54:41.333
Go for it. Yeah. Harder.

54:41.416 --> 54:42.500
Come on, harder.

54:43.291 --> 54:44.708
Come on, Lulu. Smash it.

54:45.250 --> 54:46.208
That's it!

54:46.791 --> 54:47.833
Well done!

54:49.583 --> 54:51.875
-They're mine!
-They're just for me!

54:55.041 --> 54:56.750
Your turn.

54:56.833 --> 54:58.791
Left foot on yellow.

54:58.875 --> 55:00.583
With me. Who's on yellow?

55:01.166 --> 55:03.125
Right hand on red.

55:06.083 --> 55:08.291
-He seems happy, right?
-Yeah, he's thrilled.

55:13.791 --> 55:15.625
-You okay?
-I'm fine.

55:16.541 --> 55:17.833
Left hand on green.

55:17.916 --> 55:19.333
It depends on the day.

55:21.083 --> 55:22.833
It's harder with Antoine.

55:25.041 --> 55:26.750
Lucien cries often, but…

55:27.458 --> 55:28.833
But Antoine worries me.

55:29.791 --> 55:31.666
He doesn't talk or express anything.

55:33.125 --> 55:35.708
I can see he's angry,
but he doesn't want to talk to me.

55:38.083 --> 55:39.833
He didn't want to come today.

55:40.333 --> 55:41.208
Why?

55:45.041 --> 55:46.500
He didn't want to see you.

55:54.125 --> 55:54.958
You're in here?

55:56.625 --> 55:58.000
I was looking for you.

56:02.291 --> 56:03.458
-Are you okay?
-Hm.

56:07.083 --> 56:07.916
Antoine.

56:10.041 --> 56:13.041
I've been wanting to tell you something
for a few months.

56:14.166 --> 56:16.750
I've been wanting to talk to you,
but I didn't know how.

56:17.416 --> 56:18.625
Or when…

56:21.000 --> 56:22.666
I know you're angry with me.

56:25.000 --> 56:26.583
And you're right to be angry.

56:28.083 --> 56:29.541
I'm very angry with me too.

56:33.875 --> 56:36.416
If I hadn't made the decision
to go into that hotel…

56:38.375 --> 56:40.166
all of this might never have happened.

56:43.833 --> 56:46.541
But I wanted you to know
that it's eating me up.

56:49.458 --> 56:50.875
I think about it every day.

56:51.875 --> 56:52.750
Every night.

56:52.833 --> 56:54.166
But I don't care.

56:55.791 --> 56:57.166
I don't care about you.

56:59.875 --> 57:02.166
I'm sorry. That's not what I wanted
to say to you.

57:03.750 --> 57:05.291
I'd like to be there for you.

57:06.291 --> 57:08.000
I don't give a damn about your help.

57:13.166 --> 57:15.500
I've heard you know stuff
about Dad's death.

57:15.583 --> 57:16.416
Is that true?

57:20.541 --> 57:22.791
I heard Mom talking with someone.

57:24.291 --> 57:28.625
You want to fix things?
Start by telling everyone what you know.

57:42.375 --> 57:43.333
Hello.

57:43.416 --> 57:44.250
Hello.

57:44.333 --> 57:47.666
I'm sorry, I got a bit lost.
I'm not familiar with the area.

57:47.750 --> 57:49.500
I just wanted a quiet place.

57:50.000 --> 57:52.250
Well, I don't think
anyone will bother us here.

57:52.333 --> 57:53.250
I'm listening.

57:53.750 --> 57:55.291
Would you mind showing me?

57:55.375 --> 57:58.166
-You're not recording, right?
-No, I'll even turn it off.

58:00.083 --> 58:01.125
-Thank you.
-Done.

58:01.708 --> 58:02.583
I'm listening.

58:04.375 --> 58:06.791
I wanted to have a first meeting

58:09.458 --> 58:13.666
to find out if I would put myself
or the people close to me in danger

58:14.375 --> 58:16.833
if I were to reveal
important things to you.

58:17.625 --> 58:20.375
I would like to know, first,
if you can guarantee

58:20.458 --> 58:22.250
that my name will never be disclosed.

58:22.875 --> 58:25.875
And if you have any control
over your editorial team.

58:25.958 --> 58:29.041
Journalists aren't obligated
to reveal their sources.

58:29.125 --> 58:31.625
-But they can.
-They can, but we won't.

58:33.208 --> 58:36.750
You mentioned the events at the Trianon.
How are you involved?

58:39.541 --> 58:42.250
I was there.
I was part of the tactical team.

58:43.041 --> 58:43.875
Outside?

58:45.375 --> 58:46.208
No. Inside.

58:49.416 --> 58:50.791
Madam Minister.

58:50.875 --> 58:53.416
This is Mr. Lefebvre, from the DGSI.

58:53.500 --> 58:55.583
-Madam Minister.
-Please.

59:00.458 --> 59:01.541
I'm listening.

59:01.625 --> 59:04.250
I'll go over the case for you,
Madam Minister.

59:06.166 --> 59:09.708
Seven months ago,
Colonel John Brennan, ex-Navy SEAL,

59:09.791 --> 59:12.750
member of the CIA,
came to France with his bodyguard

59:12.833 --> 59:15.250
to negotiate a substantial arms deal
with Australia.

59:22.000 --> 59:24.708
On the day of the meeting,
under the leadership of the DGSI

59:24.791 --> 59:27.000
and the command of Mr. Lefebvre,
present here,

59:28.208 --> 59:30.208
two men working for the DGSI

59:30.291 --> 59:32.875
were supposed to pick up
some of the paperwork.

59:33.666 --> 59:37.083
But, as you know,
things didn't go as planned.

01:00:17.083 --> 01:00:20.583
And then, there was
the unfortunate GIGN intervention,

01:00:20.666 --> 01:00:23.250
which forced us
to hide the identity of the two victims.

01:00:24.958 --> 01:00:27.041
We thought the story had blown over,

01:00:28.041 --> 01:00:30.333
but we just learned of a new situation

01:00:30.416 --> 01:00:32.541
that could prove to be
extremely compromising.

01:00:33.750 --> 01:00:36.291
We've learned
from an undercover journalist

01:00:36.375 --> 01:00:41.166
that Franck Lazarev, a former GIGN officer
who killed one of our men at the hotel,

01:00:41.666 --> 01:00:43.625
has contacted a journalist to tell her

01:00:43.708 --> 01:00:46.041
that he has evidence
about the identity of our men.

01:00:46.125 --> 01:00:47.000
What evidence?

01:00:47.083 --> 01:00:48.875
Some blood, on his badge.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.625
DNA is irrefutable.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:59.666
If the CIA were to learn what happened,
it would become a diplomatic disaster.

01:00:59.750 --> 01:01:02.875
We can't allow this story
to become public knowledge.

01:01:05.250 --> 01:01:06.291
You know your job.

01:01:06.958 --> 01:01:09.541
Do it however you want,
but retrieve that evidence.

01:01:10.166 --> 01:01:13.791
And once we've retrieved it,
what should we do with him?

01:01:23.333 --> 01:01:24.583
Are we going to the movies?

01:01:25.125 --> 01:01:26.125
Do you want to?

01:01:26.791 --> 01:01:27.708
Yeah.

01:01:29.791 --> 01:01:31.250
We'll go, if you want.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:35.000
Let's go.

01:01:53.833 --> 01:01:55.791
IDENTIFICATION FILE

01:01:55.875 --> 01:01:57.083
Léo!

01:01:58.125 --> 01:01:59.333
Léo!

01:02:05.208 --> 01:02:07.208
Doing okay? Did you sleep well?

01:02:08.125 --> 01:02:11.166
Do you remember the story
I told you earlier? Look.

01:02:16.125 --> 01:02:19.166
You have four hours, not a minute longer,
to bring me the badge.

01:02:19.250 --> 01:02:21.125
If I don't have what I want at 2 p.m.,

01:02:21.625 --> 01:02:25.041
I'll shoot her in the head
and bury her with lime.

01:02:25.125 --> 01:02:27.375
Don't you touch her! Do you hear me?

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:29.666
-I'll bring it. Alright.
-Okay.

01:02:29.750 --> 01:02:33.625
We'll give you a cellphone
with instructions on where to find us.

01:02:34.291 --> 01:02:38.708
Oh, by the way, I'd advise against
going to the police. You're wanted now.

01:02:38.791 --> 01:02:42.208
Stanislas Bouckaert was found dead
with three bullets in his body.

01:02:42.291 --> 01:02:44.666
Your fingerprints
were found on the weapon.

01:02:44.750 --> 01:02:47.375
Everyone saw you chasing him
near Sacré-Cœur.

01:02:47.458 --> 01:02:48.458
And apparently,

01:02:48.541 --> 01:02:52.750
you left your workplace
in a strange, sudden way.

01:02:54.583 --> 01:02:56.041
Is everything clear?

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:32.708
Sorry, guys, I forgot a briefcase.

01:05:32.791 --> 01:05:34.958
-Where is it?
-In the bathroom, I think.

01:05:41.958 --> 01:05:42.875
Hey, guys!

01:05:47.375 --> 01:05:49.916
I've got the suspect in sight.
He went out onto the roof!

01:05:51.625 --> 01:05:52.875
Go to the other side.

01:05:58.458 --> 01:05:59.583
Stop!

01:06:11.791 --> 01:06:13.041
Hey! Don't move!

01:06:18.833 --> 01:06:20.166
He's heading your way.

01:06:26.083 --> 01:06:27.333
Don't move!

01:06:28.125 --> 01:06:29.125
On the ground!

01:06:29.625 --> 01:06:30.666
On the ground!

01:06:31.208 --> 01:06:32.041
Don't move!

01:06:33.708 --> 01:06:35.125
Stop!

01:06:36.791 --> 01:06:38.583
He's going down. Let's go!

01:06:38.666 --> 01:06:40.666
Let's go! We're going down!

01:06:41.208 --> 01:06:43.375
Farther down!

01:06:44.125 --> 01:06:45.500
I don't see him anymore!

01:07:14.041 --> 01:07:15.000
Come on!

01:07:16.083 --> 01:07:19.166
Not such a tough guy anymore?
Guard up. Be serious.

01:07:19.250 --> 01:07:20.750
-Come on. That's good.
-Ben!

01:07:22.125 --> 01:07:22.958
Hey.

01:07:23.500 --> 01:07:24.666
-Mehdi?
-Yeah?

01:07:24.750 --> 01:07:26.875
-Can you watch them for two minutes?
-Sure.

01:07:26.958 --> 01:07:28.416
I won't be long, guys.

01:07:30.791 --> 01:07:33.083
What's your plan
if you don't have the key anymore?

01:07:33.166 --> 01:07:35.875
I don't know, but I need to buy some time.

01:07:35.958 --> 01:07:37.625
And I need to go get Léo.

01:07:39.750 --> 01:07:42.291
Ben, I'll understand
if you don't want to get involved.

01:07:45.750 --> 01:07:48.375
Send a message that you're on your way
with what they need.

01:07:48.458 --> 01:07:50.708
Come on, guys. A bit harder.

01:08:01.041 --> 01:08:02.625
They sent me a GPS location.

01:08:02.708 --> 01:08:05.125
It's in the Rambouillet Forest.
We've got 90 minutes.

01:08:09.958 --> 01:08:12.541
-Will this do?
-Yeah, anything's fine.

01:08:24.875 --> 01:08:26.500
-Here.
-Thanks.

01:10:31.666 --> 01:10:32.791
My phone.

01:10:40.166 --> 01:10:41.250
The badge.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:43.416
I want to see my wife first.

01:10:45.208 --> 01:10:46.208
Let's go!

01:11:04.250 --> 01:11:06.083
Are you okay?

01:11:11.083 --> 01:11:12.333
Under the motorcycle seat.

01:11:17.291 --> 01:11:18.875
Look under the motorcycle seat.

01:11:20.500 --> 01:11:21.333
It'll be okay.

01:11:45.666 --> 01:11:47.208
Let's get this over with.

01:11:55.250 --> 01:11:57.791
We'll leave a little message
for all your contacts,

01:11:57.875 --> 01:11:59.416
so they understand your actions.

01:12:00.958 --> 01:12:02.583
"I don't want this life."

01:12:03.291 --> 01:12:04.833
"I don't want this child."

01:12:07.791 --> 01:12:08.916
"Forgive me."

01:12:09.750 --> 01:12:10.583
"Franck."

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.583
DOMESTIC INTELLIGENCE SERVICES

01:12:19.416 --> 01:12:22.416
Lazarev's phone just pinged
in the middle of Rambouillet Forest.

01:12:23.916 --> 01:12:25.166
Okay, I'll pass it on.

01:12:43.041 --> 01:12:44.166
Wait.

01:12:45.041 --> 01:12:46.250
What do you want, asshole?

01:12:49.791 --> 01:12:50.666
Go check.

01:13:17.583 --> 01:13:18.500
What was it?

01:13:35.166 --> 01:13:36.041
You okay?

01:13:44.625 --> 01:13:45.583
It's done.

01:13:46.333 --> 01:13:48.041
Uh-huh. Okay.

01:13:49.291 --> 01:13:50.625
Got it. Yeah.

01:13:52.666 --> 01:13:53.833
I'll call you back.

01:13:57.208 --> 01:13:58.333
What happened?

01:13:59.916 --> 01:14:01.333
What happened?

01:14:02.041 --> 01:14:04.416
What was that third gunshot? Who fired?

01:14:06.333 --> 01:14:07.416
Go check!

01:15:05.833 --> 01:15:06.666
Let's go!

01:15:08.250 --> 01:15:09.083
Shit.

01:15:14.583 --> 01:15:15.583
Go!

01:15:19.583 --> 01:15:20.958
-You okay?
-Yeah.

01:15:21.041 --> 01:15:23.458
They're getting closer.
They're gonna hit us.

01:15:27.625 --> 01:15:28.500
Fuck.

01:15:28.583 --> 01:15:29.416
Watch out!

01:15:32.375 --> 01:15:33.291
Get down.

01:15:36.125 --> 01:15:37.250
Stay down.

01:15:50.083 --> 01:15:51.500
-You okay?
-Yeah.

01:15:56.375 --> 01:15:57.333
He's reloading!

01:16:23.791 --> 01:16:25.208
-Shit. Léo.
-What?

01:16:25.291 --> 01:16:26.250
She's hurt.

01:16:27.083 --> 01:16:28.875
-What happened?
-Do you have a belt?

01:16:28.958 --> 01:16:30.041
-Yeah.
-Give it to me.

01:16:33.125 --> 01:16:33.958
Here.

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:35.958
Lift your arm.

01:16:38.750 --> 01:16:39.708
Make it tight.

01:16:40.458 --> 01:16:41.333
Tight.

01:16:45.166 --> 01:16:46.083
Oh, fuck.

01:16:46.666 --> 01:16:47.541
Oh, fuck.

01:16:47.625 --> 01:16:49.666
-I don't want to lose it.
-You won't lose it.

01:16:49.750 --> 01:16:51.958
Listen to me.
We're not going to lose it. Okay?

01:16:56.208 --> 01:16:58.333
Léo, you need to go to the hospital.

01:16:58.875 --> 01:17:00.916
It's me they want.
Trust me, I won't be long.

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.291
Take her to Mignot.
I'll meet you there. Slow down.

01:17:03.375 --> 01:17:05.750
-What are you doing? No!
-Slow down.

01:17:24.750 --> 01:17:26.000
I'll take care of him. Go!

01:17:49.500 --> 01:17:50.333
Shit.

01:17:53.708 --> 01:17:56.333
One man down. I repeat, one man down.

01:18:03.958 --> 01:18:07.500
Inform your location.
I repeat, inform your location.

01:18:25.666 --> 01:18:26.500
Hey, Léo.

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:29.000
You okay?

01:18:31.375 --> 01:18:33.375
You're finally gonna have this kid?

01:18:33.458 --> 01:18:34.750
I'm not giving you a choice.

01:18:34.833 --> 01:18:37.916
I'm taking you to the hospital,
so I deserve to be the godfather.

01:18:38.875 --> 01:18:39.916
What are you doing?

01:18:41.250 --> 01:18:43.916
Come on, Léo. Hang in there.
Hang on. We're almost there.

01:18:57.125 --> 01:18:58.166
Suspect spotted.

01:18:58.666 --> 01:19:01.291
Sector Croix Pater.
I repeat, Sector Croix Pater.

01:19:01.875 --> 01:19:03.041
We're sending backup.

01:19:44.875 --> 01:19:46.125
Where are you, guys?

01:19:58.625 --> 01:20:02.583
Take the time
From time to time

01:20:03.166 --> 01:20:05.083
For pleasure

01:20:05.166 --> 01:20:08.250
For pleasure

01:20:19.500 --> 01:20:20.375
Stop!

01:20:46.416 --> 01:20:47.541
Hang in there, Léo.

01:20:48.458 --> 01:20:49.333
You hear me?

01:20:50.791 --> 01:20:52.083
Hey! I'm talking to you.

01:20:52.583 --> 01:20:53.708
Stay with me, okay?

01:21:21.625 --> 01:21:22.500
Go!

01:21:24.333 --> 01:21:25.583
Léo, are you okay?

01:21:26.208 --> 01:21:27.208
I'm talking to you.

01:21:28.208 --> 01:21:29.375
Léo?

01:21:32.625 --> 01:21:33.666
Ben!

01:21:33.750 --> 01:21:35.208
-Where are you?
-I'm on my way.

01:21:35.875 --> 01:21:37.083
How is Léo doing?

01:21:38.083 --> 01:21:39.375
Ben, is Léo okay?

01:21:39.458 --> 01:21:41.250
Not really. I can't keep her awake.

01:21:41.333 --> 01:21:42.333
Let me talk to her.

01:21:43.375 --> 01:21:45.083
Léo, it's Franck.

01:21:45.166 --> 01:21:47.375
-Can she hear me?
-Yeah, go ahead.

01:21:47.875 --> 01:21:48.708
Léo.

01:21:49.333 --> 01:21:50.541
Hang on, my love.

01:21:50.625 --> 01:21:52.083
I'm begging you, be strong.

01:21:52.583 --> 01:21:55.583
I love you. We're going to have that baby.
Do you hear me?

01:21:56.208 --> 01:21:58.291
It's our baby.
Nothing can happen to our baby.

01:21:58.375 --> 01:21:59.375
Can you hear me?

01:21:59.875 --> 01:22:00.708
Léo?

01:22:01.333 --> 01:22:02.208
Léo?

01:22:03.250 --> 01:22:05.250
-Ben, what's going on?
-Franck?

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:07.416
She lost consciousness.

01:22:08.125 --> 01:22:09.875
Hurry, Ben. I'm begging you.

01:22:09.958 --> 01:22:11.500
As fast as you can. Hurry.

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:13.458
I'm doing my best, man.

01:22:35.583 --> 01:22:36.583
Yes, hello?

01:22:38.541 --> 01:22:39.500
Very well.

01:22:40.458 --> 01:22:41.708
I'll let you know.

01:22:46.375 --> 01:22:47.208
Let's go.

01:23:01.666 --> 01:23:03.166
Ben, where are you?

01:23:03.250 --> 01:23:05.541
I'm on the D7. I'll be in Versailles soon.

01:23:05.625 --> 01:23:08.375
-Cut through the castle, through the park.
-Okay.

01:23:19.208 --> 01:23:20.208
Watch out!

01:23:52.500 --> 01:23:53.666
Fuck! Watch out!

01:24:14.625 --> 01:24:15.791
What's that?

01:24:44.666 --> 01:24:45.750
Fuck!

01:24:59.583 --> 01:25:02.125
EMERGENCY

The emergency department
at Mignot hospital.

01:25:06.250 --> 01:25:07.833
I'll be there in two minutes.

01:26:02.708 --> 01:26:04.375
Franck! Stop!

01:26:05.916 --> 01:26:07.125
Stop! Franck!

01:26:09.125 --> 01:26:10.375
Come on, it's over.

01:26:12.208 --> 01:26:13.250
Hands up, Franck.

01:26:13.750 --> 01:26:14.708
Stand up!

01:26:20.791 --> 01:26:21.750
Come on, come closer.

01:26:33.416 --> 01:26:34.750
Come on. Come here, buddy.

01:26:42.875 --> 01:26:43.750
Franck.

01:26:44.291 --> 01:26:46.416
Franck, don't be an idiot! Franck!

01:27:06.458 --> 01:27:07.750
I won't be long.

01:27:14.458 --> 01:27:15.541
Hang in there, Léo.

01:27:16.041 --> 01:27:17.416
Hang in there, I'm here.

01:27:18.416 --> 01:27:19.250
It'll be okay.

01:27:20.458 --> 01:27:22.625
Ben! Medic!

01:27:22.708 --> 01:27:24.250
-He's alive.
-Hang in there.

01:27:24.333 --> 01:27:25.208
It'll be okay.

01:27:29.750 --> 01:27:30.875
Please, help!

01:27:32.208 --> 01:27:33.250
Please, help!

01:27:37.583 --> 01:27:38.875
Is anybody here?

01:27:38.958 --> 01:27:41.416
-Sir, what's going on? You can't yell.
-It's my wife.

01:27:41.500 --> 01:27:44.250
She took a bullet to her shoulder.
She's eight months pregnant.

01:27:44.333 --> 01:27:47.791
-Her water broke. She's lost blood.
-Okay. We're taking her to the OR.

01:27:49.500 --> 01:27:51.458
Sir, you stay here.
We'll take care of her.

01:27:52.083 --> 01:27:53.416
Ma'am, can you hear me?

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:54.958
Alright, OR two.

01:27:58.958 --> 01:27:59.791
Franck!

01:28:04.541 --> 01:28:05.916
Franck, it's over now.

01:28:08.833 --> 01:28:09.666
Come on.

01:28:10.458 --> 01:28:11.541
Please come.

01:28:15.208 --> 01:28:16.166
Come with us.

01:28:21.791 --> 01:28:22.916
Come on.

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:23.833
Let's go.

01:29:03.541 --> 01:29:05.541
Look who's here.

01:29:10.250 --> 01:29:11.291
Hello.

01:29:18.083 --> 01:29:19.833
Hello. Who's that?

01:29:23.666 --> 01:29:25.000
It's Daddy.

01:29:35.291 --> 01:29:37.458
-Hello.
-It's your Daddy.

01:29:37.541 --> 01:29:38.541
Hi, my girl.

01:29:39.625 --> 01:29:40.791

And, in the envelope,
you have the test results.

01:30:17.750 --> 01:30:21.000
After that, it's up to the powers that be,

01:30:21.083 --> 01:30:22.958
but you should be good to go.

01:30:24.625 --> 01:30:25.500
Thank you.

01:30:26.875 --> 01:30:28.625
