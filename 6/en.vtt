00:24.520 --> 00:26.520
It scares us just thinking about it.

00:26.680 --> 00:28.760
When you hear it, you're gonna
think we 're insane.

00:28.960 --> 00:31.610
Try us. Please, from the start.

00:33.880 --> 00:38.890
It started out small, like a hand
or a leg was in a different position.

00:39.040 --> 00:41.570
Then its head was looking up
instead of down.

00:41.720 --> 00:44.770
And then one day, it was in
a completely different room.

00:44.920 --> 00:46.490
It was moving around by itself.

00:46.640 --> 00:50.800
Ever think maybe somebody had a key
to your apartment and was playing a trick?

00:50.960 --> 00:52.640
That's exactly what we thought.

00:53.120 --> 00:55.810
But never once did we find any
sign or evidence of intrusion.

00:55.960 --> 00:58.730
And this all led you to believe
that the doll was possessed?

00:58.880 --> 01:00.290
Yes.

01:00.440 --> 01:04.160
Camilla got in touch with a medium. We
learned from her that a 7-year-old girl...

01:04.320 --> 01:07.240
...named Annabelle Higgins
had died in this apartment.

01:07.400 --> 01:11.120
She was lonely and took a liking
to my doll.

01:11.720 --> 01:13.640
All she wanted was to be friends.

01:13.880 --> 01:16.170
When we heard this,
we felt really sorry for her.

01:16.360 --> 01:19.010
I mean, we're nurses, we help people.

01:19.360 --> 01:20.490
So...

01:21.680 --> 01:24.130
...we gave her permission
to move into the doll.

01:24.280 --> 01:26.280
Wait, you did what?

01:26.680 --> 01:29.080
She wanted to live with us
by inhabiting the doll.

01:29.240 --> 01:30.450
We said yes.

01:30.600 --> 01:33.000
But then things got worse.

01:47.040 --> 01:48.370
God.

01:51.200 --> 01:54.360
When we came home,
she was sitting in the hallway.

01:54.520 --> 01:56.970
But we had left her in the spare room.

02:34.880 --> 02:36.960
Debbie! Debbie, wait!

03:51.800 --> 03:53.770
We are beyond terrified.

03:53.960 --> 03:57.930
We don't know what's going on
or what to do. Can you help us?

03:59.000 --> 04:00.530
Yes, we can.

04:00.960 --> 04:05.010
Now, firstly, there's no such thing
as Annabelle, and there never was.

04:05.160 --> 04:07.240
Ghosts don't possess such power.

04:07.400 --> 04:10.050
I think what we have here is something
extremely manipulative.

04:10.200 --> 04:12.170
It's something inhuman.

04:12.600 --> 04:14.840
It was a big mistake
acknowledging this doll.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.160
And through that,
the inhuman spirit tricked you.

04:17.360 --> 04:20.090
You gave it permission
to infest your lives.

04:20.600 --> 04:22.490
What's an inhuman spirit?

04:23.080 --> 04:26.530
It's something that's never walked
the earth in human form.

04:26.920 --> 04:28.810
It's something demonic.

04:32.640 --> 04:34.770
So the doll was never possessed?

04:34.960 --> 04:36.850
No, no, it was used as a conduit.

04:37.040 --> 04:39.360
It was moved around to give
the impression of possession.

04:39.520 --> 04:43.210
Demonic spirits don't possess things,
they possess people.

04:44.280 --> 04:46.440
It wanted to get inside of you.

04:55.800 --> 04:59.200
All right, that's good, Drew.
You can shut it down now.

05:00.880 --> 05:02.040
Hit the lights.

05:05.040 --> 05:07.170
So we got the church to
send a priest over...

05:07.320 --> 05:09.400
...to bless the house and the occupants.

05:09.560 --> 05:13.250
Whatever was oppressing that apartment
was no longer with them. Any questions?

05:15.360 --> 05:16.410
Yes.

05:16.560 --> 05:18.210
Where's the doll now?

05:18.360 --> 05:20.120
Someplace safe.

05:21.480 --> 05:23.560
- Yep.
- So, what are you guys?

05:23.760 --> 05:25.570
I mean, what do people call you?

05:27.440 --> 05:31.490
Uh, well, we've been called Demonologists.
That's one name for us.

05:31.680 --> 05:33.360
Ghost hunters, paranormal researchers.

05:33.560 --> 05:35.850
- Kooks.
- Ha-ha-ha.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.450
Wackos.

05:37.600 --> 05:41.760
But we prefer to be known simply
as Ed and Lorraine Warren.

06:42.320 --> 06:43.850
Here we are.

06:47.480 --> 06:49.450
Wow, hear that?

06:49.600 --> 06:51.250
- I don't hear anything.
- Exactly.

06:51.400 --> 06:52.640
Oh. Ha!

06:52.800 --> 06:56.090
- Okay. Guys, we are here!
- Get out of the car.

06:56.240 --> 06:58.130
Oh, God, we're in the middle of nowhere.

06:58.280 --> 07:01.330
Are you so excited?
Where's my "yes"? Where's my "yes"? Yes!

07:01.520 --> 07:02.600
I'll race you!

07:02.760 --> 07:05.000
- Are you guys excited?
- Yes!

07:05.200 --> 07:07.170
- I'm so excited!
- Come on, Sadie!

07:07.360 --> 07:08.850
I get my own room!

07:09.000 --> 07:11.690
Are you kidding me?
No dibs on the rooms!

07:11.840 --> 07:12.970
- What?
- What?

07:13.160 --> 07:16.850
So do I get to pick my own room?
Or do I have no choice in that either?

07:19.360 --> 07:22.680
Well, first cute boy she meets,
she'll forget about Jersey.

07:22.840 --> 07:24.130
- Great.
- I hope.

07:24.280 --> 07:25.490
I can't wait.

07:26.120 --> 07:27.360
Come on, Sadie.

07:28.360 --> 07:29.890
Sadie, let's go.

07:30.880 --> 07:32.480
Hey, come.

07:33.720 --> 07:35.210
What's the matter with you?

07:35.360 --> 07:37.120
Hey, come on, girl.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.890
All right, suit yourself.

07:47.320 --> 07:49.080
- What's your name?
- What's your name?

07:49.280 --> 07:51.120
- Who's your daddy?
- Who's your daddy?

07:51.320 --> 07:52.970
- He rich?
- Is he rich like me?

07:53.120 --> 07:54.250
Watch your step.

07:54.400 --> 07:55.850
Coming through.

07:56.680 --> 07:57.730
Whoa, watch out, Dad.

07:57.880 --> 07:59.760
- Where do you want it?
- In the living room.

07:59.880 --> 08:02.880
- Andrea, where's my wind chime?
- I think Nancy's got it in the other room.

08:03.000 --> 08:05.240
Thanks. Hey, Nancy,
have you seen my wind chime?

08:05.400 --> 08:07.050
- Oh, this one?
- Yeah, thanks.

08:07.200 --> 08:10.040
- You're gonna have to catch it.
- Nancy! Let go! Give it here.

08:10.520 --> 08:12.090
You're so mean.

08:13.080 --> 08:14.840
Hey, Mom, can I hang up
my wind chime?

08:15.000 --> 08:17.400
Of course. There's a line outside
you can hang it on.

08:17.600 --> 08:20.250
Honey, have April come in, okay?
It's gonna be dark soon.

08:20.400 --> 08:21.690
Okay.

08:30.680 --> 08:33.890
Come on, April! Mom wants us inside!

08:34.520 --> 08:36.730
Look what I found, Cindy.

08:56.360 --> 08:57.730
One...

08:58.240 --> 08:59.290
...two...

08:59.440 --> 09:00.570
...three.

09:00.720 --> 09:02.610
Come on, come on, come on.
No peeking.

09:02.760 --> 09:04.130
Four.

09:04.320 --> 09:07.450
Are you guys done with the pizza?
I don't want it going to waste.

09:07.600 --> 09:10.050
- Let's go.
- It's expensive feeding you girls.

09:10.200 --> 09:13.600
Seven, eight, nine, ten.

09:13.760 --> 09:14.920
Where should I hide?

09:15.280 --> 09:17.280
Ready or not, here I come!

09:18.800 --> 09:20.040
Okay, clap.

09:28.480 --> 09:30.610
- Whoa!
- You don't know the house well enough.

09:30.760 --> 09:31.840
Someone's gonna get hurt.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.290
I'm okay, I'm okay.

09:35.160 --> 09:36.570
Second clap.

09:42.760 --> 09:44.090
That's cheating.

09:56.680 --> 09:57.970
Clap.

10:00.520 --> 10:01.890
- Got You!
- Aah!

10:02.480 --> 10:04.530
- Are you okay? Um...
- Yeah.

10:05.120 --> 10:06.570
All right, what did we break now?

10:06.720 --> 10:08.720
- I didn't mean to.
- Move out of there, please.

10:08.960 --> 10:10.640
It was Christine's fault.

10:10.800 --> 10:13.040
- Oh, jeez.
- My fault? Oh, my God.

10:13.200 --> 10:15.120
- Christine did it.
- No, I didn't.

10:15.280 --> 10:17.440
- You pushed me.
- No, no, you fell back.

10:17.600 --> 10:20.290
Hey, Nancy, can you go get me
the matches, please?

10:21.200 --> 10:22.330
What's going on?

10:22.480 --> 10:24.480
- Nancy broke something.
- Shut up.

10:24.680 --> 10:26.520
- What broke?
- It's the Wall.

10:26.680 --> 10:29.730
- Whoa.
- I think we have a cellar or something.

10:30.560 --> 10:33.290
I wanna see, I wanna see.
Move, move, move.

10:34.040 --> 10:36.570
Here, matches. Thank you.

10:37.160 --> 10:38.760
- I wanna see.
- You can see.

10:38.920 --> 10:40.680
- I wanna see.
- You can all see.

10:40.840 --> 10:42.050
Move!

10:52.240 --> 10:54.080
Oh, man.

10:58.840 --> 10:59.890
Huh.

11:01.680 --> 11:02.920
Roger?

11:04.080 --> 11:05.370
What do you see down there?

11:06.240 --> 11:09.050
Just, uh, hard to tell, you know?

11:09.480 --> 11:13.170
It's an old piano
and a whole bunch of garbage.

11:15.440 --> 11:17.730
Agh. Son of a...

11:21.280 --> 11:22.960
Wow.

11:26.880 --> 11:28.250
Rog?

11:31.600 --> 11:33.010
Come on up.

11:36.240 --> 11:37.970
I don't want you girls going down there.

11:38.120 --> 11:39.850
- That place is loaded with spiders.
- Ew!

11:40.040 --> 11:41.090
Just relax. Okay.

11:41.240 --> 11:43.560
Stop it, Nancy. It's not funny.

11:43.960 --> 11:47.440
We've got extra square footage anyway.
I'll check it out in the morning.

11:47.640 --> 11:49.800
- I wonder why it was boarded up.
- I don't know.

11:49.960 --> 11:51.040
Okay, show's over.

11:51.160 --> 11:52.890
- Five minutes.
- No more minutes.

11:53.040 --> 11:55.410
- Up to bed. Please. Thank you.
- Right to bed.

11:59.600 --> 12:00.930
Man, I'm fried.

12:01.800 --> 12:03.480
Something's up with Sadie.

12:03.960 --> 12:07.600
Yeah, I don't know what her problem is.
Couldn't get her to come inside.

12:07.960 --> 12:09.560
We can't leave her out there.

12:09.720 --> 12:11.880
She's all right.
I got her on a chain.

12:13.160 --> 12:15.970
Sadie, hey, be quiet.

12:18.960 --> 12:20.960
Thanks for making this work.

12:21.120 --> 12:23.010
I know it was a lot to bite off.

12:23.840 --> 12:26.320
It's gonna be great, isn't it?

12:26.920 --> 12:28.760
I think it's great already.

12:30.040 --> 12:31.120
Yeah.

12:33.160 --> 12:36.000
You still too fried to christen
the new house?

12:36.960 --> 12:38.450
Who said I'm fried?

12:39.160 --> 12:42.000
- Ain't nobody here's fried.
- Ha, ha.

13:17.360 --> 13:18.600
Mom?

13:19.000 --> 13:21.210
Hey. How did you guys sleep?

13:21.400 --> 13:22.560
I'm cold.

13:22.720 --> 13:24.250
It is chilly, isn't it?

13:24.560 --> 13:28.250
You think maybe we could have bought
a house with a toilet that actually works?

13:28.400 --> 13:29.450
Tell your father.

13:29.600 --> 13:32.730
And there was a funky smell in my
room last night. Like something died.

13:32.880 --> 13:34.480
- Is it still there?
- No.

13:34.640 --> 13:35.690
Problem solved.

14:01.400 --> 14:02.560
Roger?

14:04.120 --> 14:05.530
Roger?

14:05.920 --> 14:07.450
Down here, honey.

14:12.600 --> 14:13.650
Morning.

14:15.600 --> 14:17.890
Ooh. Whoa.

14:18.080 --> 14:20.730
This is gonna take some
serious elbow grease.

14:20.920 --> 14:22.080
Yeah.

14:23.120 --> 14:24.880
Oh, my God.

14:31.800 --> 14:33.640
What are we gonna do
with all this stuff?

14:33.800 --> 14:36.250
Well, we probably ought
to go through it, you know?

14:36.400 --> 14:38.800
There might be some antiques down here
worth a lot.

14:38.960 --> 14:41.650
Yeah, or just a lot of junk
the previous owner didn't want.

14:42.080 --> 14:44.130
- It's ours now.
- Knock yourself out.

14:44.800 --> 14:46.770
- I'm gonna make some coffee.
- Okay.

14:46.920 --> 14:48.970
I'm gonna see if I can get
this furnace working.

14:49.120 --> 14:50.930
Yeah, that'd be nice. It's freezing.

14:51.080 --> 14:52.240
Yeah.

15:01.280 --> 15:02.880
Hmm.

15:05.280 --> 15:08.050
Sadie! Come here, Sadie!

15:08.360 --> 15:09.650
Mommy!

15:10.840 --> 15:12.290
Mommy, where's Sadie?

15:12.440 --> 15:16.760
She's outside. You know, I'm sure she's hungry by now.
Why don't you go and get her.

15:17.760 --> 15:18.810
- Whoa.
- Morning, Dad.

15:18.960 --> 15:20.960
- Can you hold this?
- Sure.

15:21.120 --> 15:22.800
- Sadie!
- Slow it down, Scoot.

15:22.960 --> 15:24.250
- Roger.
- Yeah.

15:24.440 --> 15:27.570
This clock stopped at 3:07,
and so did the one in the hallway.

15:27.720 --> 15:29.130
That's weird.

15:30.920 --> 15:32.810
Maybe it got knocked around in the move.

15:32.960 --> 15:35.850
Speaking of knocked around,
what did you do to me last night?

15:36.000 --> 15:38.770
- Ouch. I didn't do that. Did I?
- I don't know.

15:38.920 --> 15:41.370
Sadie!

15:51.080 --> 15:53.370
April! April!

15:53.520 --> 15:56.130
What's...? April! What's going on?

15:56.280 --> 15:58.600
- What happened?
- Oh, my God!

15:59.000 --> 16:00.410
Oh, Sadie.

16:10.520 --> 16:12.570
We keep everything locked in here.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.760
Feel free to look around.

16:15.200 --> 16:16.800
Just don't touch anything.

16:19.200 --> 16:20.770
Wow.

16:22.040 --> 16:23.530
This is crazy.

16:25.520 --> 16:28.440
So all these are taken from cases
you've investigated?

16:28.600 --> 16:32.570
That's right. Everything you see
in here is either haunted, cursed...

16:32.760 --> 16:35.680
...or has been used in some kind
of ritualistic practice.

16:36.400 --> 16:38.000
Nothing's a toy.

16:38.160 --> 16:39.840
Not even the toy monkey.

16:41.280 --> 16:42.730
Don't touch it.

16:44.920 --> 16:49.400
Oh, ahem. Well, isn't it scary,
or doesn't it worry you...

16:49.560 --> 16:51.850
...to have all these items
right in your home?

16:52.000 --> 16:55.400
That's why we have a priest that comes by
once a month to bless the room.

16:55.560 --> 16:56.770
Well, the way I see it is:

16:56.920 --> 16:59.570
It's safer for these things
to be in here than out there.

16:59.720 --> 17:01.530
It's kind of like keeping guns
off the street.

17:01.680 --> 17:04.760
Why not just throw them
in an incinerator? Destroy them.

17:04.960 --> 17:06.850
Well, that would only destroy the vessel.

17:07.360 --> 17:10.170
Sometimes it's better to keep
the genie in the bottle.

17:11.440 --> 17:14.210
Say, is the, uh, Annabelle doll here?

17:16.120 --> 17:17.490
Right this way.

17:19.800 --> 17:21.090
Yeah.

17:29.880 --> 17:32.330
- You said she's a conduit?
- That's right.

17:32.480 --> 17:33.690
What does that mean?

17:33.840 --> 17:37.690
A very powerful demonic
has latched itself onto her.

17:37.840 --> 17:40.810
So when you guys investigate
these hauntings...

17:40.960 --> 17:43.200
...how do you stop them
from latching onto you?

17:43.360 --> 17:44.930
We have to take great precaution.

17:45.120 --> 17:46.720
But what about your wife?

17:47.600 --> 17:48.970
What about her?

17:50.080 --> 17:51.890
Well, Father Gordon told me that...

17:52.040 --> 17:53.530
Well, that was different.

17:54.080 --> 17:56.890
What happened to my wife
happened during an exorcism.

17:57.040 --> 17:58.720
Well, what's the difference?

18:00.480 --> 18:01.770
Excuse me.

18:03.560 --> 18:04.800
Honey, what are you doing?

18:05.240 --> 18:06.400
Come here.

18:06.600 --> 18:08.920
You know better. All right?

18:09.080 --> 18:10.530
Georgiana?

18:10.800 --> 18:13.090
- Come on. Did you touch anything?
- No.

18:13.240 --> 18:14.570
All right, come on, honey.

18:15.400 --> 18:17.970
- Georgiana! Could you take Judy upstairs?
- Oh, sure.

18:18.120 --> 18:20.600
You can't go into this room,
no matter what, remember?

18:20.760 --> 18:22.210
- Yes, Daddy.
- All right.

18:23.200 --> 18:24.280
- Go on.
- Okay, come on.

18:24.440 --> 18:27.490
Let's see if I can find you
a little snack, okay? Come on.

18:35.720 --> 18:37.800
Hey. What's going on in here?

18:37.960 --> 18:40.440
- Daddy, look.
- You look very pretty.

18:40.600 --> 18:42.970
All right, all done.
Go get dressed for dinner.

18:43.120 --> 18:45.960
- I'm wearing it to dinner.
- No, you're not!

18:47.080 --> 18:48.370
Here you go.

18:49.120 --> 18:50.450
How'd it go?

18:50.600 --> 18:52.730
Oh, I think he may write
a positive article.

18:52.880 --> 18:54.800
Ooh, a non-skeptic.

18:55.400 --> 18:56.690
That's a pleasant change.

18:56.840 --> 18:58.000
Yeah.

19:04.880 --> 19:06.640
Stop blaming yourself.

19:17.600 --> 19:19.050
No sugar.

19:20.160 --> 19:21.690
Be right back.

20:17.480 --> 20:19.450
Not funny, Nancy.

20:20.600 --> 20:21.840
What?

20:22.640 --> 20:24.610
Stop grabbing my foot.

20:24.800 --> 20:26.930
Shut up, I didn't do anything.

20:27.760 --> 20:29.210
Yeah, right.

20:30.920 --> 20:32.890
And stop farting.

20:33.320 --> 20:35.130
It really stinks.

20:35.560 --> 20:39.040
Don't blame that on me. It's you. Pew.

22:55.320 --> 22:56.400
Dad?

22:56.600 --> 22:58.600
Andrea, what are you doing out of bed?

22:58.840 --> 23:00.050
What's that sound?

23:00.200 --> 23:04.130
It's Cindy. She's in my room.
She's sleepwalking again.

23:19.560 --> 23:21.690
I've never seen her do this before.

23:25.840 --> 23:28.240
I remembered you saying not
to wake her if she's like this.

23:28.400 --> 23:30.320
No, we just put her back to bed.

23:30.480 --> 23:33.010
Hey, hey. Sweetie. Shh.

23:33.880 --> 23:35.170
Let's go back to bed.

23:46.360 --> 23:47.960
She's okay. Good night.

23:48.120 --> 23:49.330
Night.

24:02.320 --> 24:05.450
She's sleepwalking again?
She hasn't done that for a while.

24:06.120 --> 24:09.200
She ended up in Andrea's room too.
I think kind of freaked her out.

24:09.360 --> 24:11.970
- That's not good. What are we gonna do?
- I don't know.

24:12.120 --> 24:14.690
- Honey, you got another bruise here.
- Hmm?

24:14.960 --> 24:16.290
Does that hurt?

24:18.240 --> 24:19.370
That's weird.

24:19.560 --> 24:22.480
I don't know. Will you do me a favor,
go see a doctor for that?

24:23.320 --> 24:25.610
- Yeah, I will. Drive safe.
- Yeah.

24:25.760 --> 24:27.490
- I love you.
- I love you too.

24:57.960 --> 24:59.090
Bye!

24:59.240 --> 25:00.730
Love you!

25:01.960 --> 25:04.770
- Cindy, you have your lunch?
- Yeah.

25:06.320 --> 25:08.400
Yes, I do.

25:08.560 --> 25:10.400
I miss Sadie a lot.

25:10.720 --> 25:12.930
She was my best friend.

25:14.120 --> 25:16.010
You're my friend, right?

25:17.680 --> 25:19.250
Yeah, let's play.

25:25.440 --> 25:28.130
- Who are you talking to?
- Rory.

25:28.520 --> 25:29.680
Rory?

25:30.080 --> 25:32.080
- He's my new friend.
- Oh, really?

25:32.240 --> 25:35.320
- Yeah, do you want to see him?
- Yeah. Uh-huh. How?

25:35.480 --> 25:36.930
With this.

25:37.080 --> 25:40.770
When the music stops, you see him
in the mirror standing behind you.

25:41.640 --> 25:42.800
Okay.

25:42.960 --> 25:44.880
But you have to twist the key.

25:45.040 --> 25:46.250
Okay.

26:09.920 --> 26:11.410
- Boo, Mommy! Ha-ha!
- Oh!

26:11.920 --> 26:14.890
- April, you just gave me a heart attack.
- Got you!

26:15.840 --> 26:18.920
Well, okay, I guess Rory
doesn't want to see me, huh?

26:19.080 --> 26:20.320
Hmm. Oh, well.

26:20.560 --> 26:22.160
Can we play hide-and-clap?

26:22.320 --> 26:24.610
Hide-and-cla...?
Oh, honey, I don't want to play.

26:24.760 --> 26:28.370
- Please! Nobody ever lets me play.
- Okay, okay.

26:30.040 --> 26:33.330
Remember, you get to ask me
for three claps.

26:33.480 --> 26:34.530
Okay.

26:34.680 --> 26:37.890
One, two, three.

26:38.040 --> 26:39.690
- I'm gonna go hide now!
- Okay.

26:39.840 --> 26:42.530
Four, five...

26:42.680 --> 26:45.570
...six, seven...

26:45.720 --> 26:48.090
...eight, nine...

26:48.680 --> 26:49.970
...ten!

26:52.640 --> 26:54.170
First clap!

27:13.680 --> 27:15.490
Ow. Shit.

27:15.640 --> 27:17.170
Second clap!

27:32.680 --> 27:35.050
April.

27:40.920 --> 27:42.450
April.

27:53.000 --> 27:55.690
Oh, I know where you're hiding.

27:55.880 --> 27:57.960
Give me the third clap.

28:06.520 --> 28:07.970
I'm gonna get you now.

28:15.320 --> 28:17.050
I can hear you breathing.

28:17.640 --> 28:19.050
April.

28:20.040 --> 28:21.450
April.

28:28.080 --> 28:30.450
Ha, ha. You took your blindfold off. I win!

28:30.640 --> 28:34.490
You weren't even warm, Mom.
I was in Christine and Nancy's room.

28:38.960 --> 28:42.810
I gotta have some routes here,
or I'm gonna lose the insurance on the rig.

28:44.840 --> 28:47.490
That's like half of my rate, man.

28:49.160 --> 28:51.160
Yeah, okay.

28:52.240 --> 28:54.240
I'll, uh... Yeah, I'll take it.

28:54.400 --> 28:55.690
Thank you.

28:58.400 --> 29:01.370
- What's the route?
- It's, uh, Florida.

29:01.520 --> 29:04.250
It's a week turnaround. I start tomorrow.

29:05.040 --> 29:06.570
We'll get through this.

29:08.480 --> 29:09.610
Yeah.

29:09.760 --> 29:11.090
Come on, let's go to bed.

29:35.480 --> 29:39.010
Stop it, Nancy. It's not funny anymore.

29:39.160 --> 29:42.240
I'm trying to sleep,
please stop grabbing my feet.

31:26.600 --> 31:28.050
Nancy?

31:30.040 --> 31:31.610
Nancy?

31:34.000 --> 31:35.730
What are you doing?

31:39.320 --> 31:40.650
Christine?

31:42.360 --> 31:43.440
Are you all right?

31:45.360 --> 31:46.770
Do you see it?

31:49.560 --> 31:50.770
See what?

31:56.240 --> 31:58.320
There's someone behind the door.

31:58.480 --> 31:59.720
What?

32:02.200 --> 32:04.930
There's someone standing over there.

32:07.200 --> 32:09.410
I don't see anyone.

32:11.840 --> 32:14.160
It's looking right at us.

32:23.520 --> 32:24.930
Nancy, don't! Nancy.

32:25.080 --> 32:27.530
No, no. Look. Look.

32:27.680 --> 32:31.160
Look, there's no one here. See?

32:32.040 --> 32:34.810
Ugh. It's that smell again.

32:35.120 --> 32:37.280
Oh, my God.

32:38.000 --> 32:40.920
It's standing right behind you.

32:56.720 --> 32:59.930
Christine?! Christine! Christine!

33:00.960 --> 33:02.450
God, it won't op...

33:03.800 --> 33:05.720
- Christine!
- No! No! No!

33:05.920 --> 33:08.920
- What's going on? What happened?
- There was someone else in here!

33:09.080 --> 33:10.130
- What?
- Where?

33:10.280 --> 33:13.570
By the door.
It was behind the door.

33:13.760 --> 33:16.290
Honey, there's nothing in here.
There's nobody in here.

33:16.440 --> 33:18.250
There was someone else in here!

33:18.400 --> 33:22.850
I was just sleeping, and then
I felt somebody grab my feet.

33:23.000 --> 33:25.320
So I thought it was Nancy.

33:25.520 --> 33:28.810
Well, honey, I'm pretty sure
that it was just a bad dream.

33:28.960 --> 33:31.570
No! It talked to me!

33:31.840 --> 33:33.650
It said...

33:34.160 --> 33:37.880
...that it wants my family dead.

33:44.920 --> 33:47.400
Mr. Winston!

33:47.960 --> 33:49.560
Winston? Winston?

33:49.920 --> 33:51.330
Get behind him.

33:52.120 --> 33:53.170
Where you off to?

33:53.320 --> 33:55.800
I just gotta run to the store
for a few things.

33:57.160 --> 33:59.970
- Why do you even try?
- What? What do you mean?

34:00.120 --> 34:02.690
In 15 years have you
ever been able to lie to me?

34:03.920 --> 34:06.810
Father Gordon called. He's got
a case he wants us to look into.

34:06.960 --> 34:09.530
I said I'd go check it out myself.
Lorraine, myself.

34:09.680 --> 34:11.050
I'm going with you.

34:11.960 --> 34:14.280
I know you're worried
it's gonna happen again.

34:14.440 --> 34:16.250
Yeah, I am. I really am.

34:19.960 --> 34:23.930
Maybe it's just time we take a break.
Write that book.

34:25.200 --> 34:27.970
Do you remember what you said to me
on our wedding night?

34:28.400 --> 34:29.970
"Can we do it again?"

34:32.840 --> 34:34.000
After that.

34:36.440 --> 34:40.240
You said that God brought us together
for a reason. Right?

34:40.480 --> 34:43.370
I'm pretty sure it's not to write a book.

34:46.040 --> 34:47.720
I'm gonna get dressed.

34:51.160 --> 34:53.370
We've isolated the
disturbances to the attic.

34:53.520 --> 34:54.880
I want you to listen for a second.

34:56.200 --> 34:57.280
Oh, my God, that's it.

34:58.920 --> 35:00.370
Do it again, Ed.

35:02.240 --> 35:05.560
Right now it's just my weight. But you
take the water coming off the pipe...

35:05.720 --> 35:08.290
...combined with the wind coming
through the broken window...

35:08.440 --> 35:10.800
...these boards are gonna expand
and rub against each other.

35:10.960 --> 35:14.730
You heard it all through the house because
of these pipes leading to the radiator.

35:14.920 --> 35:16.840
So this place isn't haunted?

35:17.000 --> 35:18.600
No, it rarely is.

35:18.800 --> 35:22.570
Yeah, there's usually always
some kind of rational explanation.

36:04.880 --> 36:07.450
Girls, it's way past your bedtime.

38:04.560 --> 38:06.050
Who is that?

39:08.440 --> 39:11.010
Who's ever down there,
I'm gonna lock you in now!

39:11.680 --> 39:12.730
Aah! Unh.

40:02.320 --> 40:03.810
Aah!

40:04.920 --> 40:06.450
Help!

40:06.600 --> 40:08.410
Andrea! Help!

40:33.080 --> 40:35.530
Hey, wanna play hide-and-clap?

40:38.680 --> 40:40.360
Aah!

41:10.160 --> 41:11.400
Cindy?

41:26.200 --> 41:28.040
Okay, now...

41:29.280 --> 41:30.520
All right?

41:30.920 --> 41:32.290
All right, come on.

41:32.640 --> 41:33.880
Come on.

41:34.840 --> 41:36.130
There you go.

41:36.720 --> 41:40.090
Okay, you can just sleep with me tonight,
all right?

41:44.960 --> 41:46.330
There you go.

41:47.720 --> 41:48.880
There.

42:52.520 --> 42:54.970
- Andrea?
- Help! Help! Help!

42:57.160 --> 42:58.760
- Who's in here?
- Andrea!

42:58.920 --> 43:01.130
Andrea? Andrea!

43:01.280 --> 43:02.410
In here!

43:02.600 --> 43:05.050
Help, Daddy! Help, it's Andrea!

43:05.200 --> 43:06.650
- Who's in here?
- Andrea!

43:07.120 --> 43:08.610
What happened?

43:10.760 --> 43:13.210
Somebody, goddamn it,
tell me what's going on here?

43:17.400 --> 43:22.280
Fear is defined as a feeling of agitation
and anxiety caused by the presence...

43:22.440 --> 43:23.970
...or imminence of danger.

43:24.160 --> 43:28.640
Whether it's a ghost, a spirit
or an entity, they all feed on it.

43:28.800 --> 43:29.850
Take Maurice here.

43:30.040 --> 43:33.200
A French-Canadian farmer with
no more than a third-grade education...

43:33.360 --> 43:36.890
...yet after he was possessed, spoke
some of the best Latin I'd ever heard.

43:37.040 --> 43:38.280
Sometimes backwards.

43:38.440 --> 43:42.160
He'd been molested by his father,
who had also tortured him repeatedly.

43:43.440 --> 43:45.810
A dark spirit made its home in this man.

43:45.960 --> 43:50.410
Now, if you look into his eyes,
you can see him tearing blood.

43:57.960 --> 43:59.410
And like that...

43:59.560 --> 44:03.720
...an upside-down cross started
to appear from within his body.

44:06.600 --> 44:08.680
All right, Drew, you
can hit the lights.

44:09.160 --> 44:10.210
Oh.

44:10.360 --> 44:12.730
Did you personally
perform the exorcism?

44:12.920 --> 44:15.730
No, I'm not authorized.
But I've assisted on many.

44:15.920 --> 44:17.840
See, an exorcism
can be very dangerous...

44:18.000 --> 44:21.050
...not only for the victim,
but for anyone in the room.

44:21.720 --> 44:24.160
- What happened to Maurice?
- He tried to kill his wife...

44:24.400 --> 44:27.640
...but instead shot her in the arm
and then turned the gun on himself.

44:27.800 --> 44:31.250
Maurice had a very troubled life
with little to live for...

44:31.400 --> 44:34.290
...and not even an exorcist
could bring him back.

44:34.840 --> 44:37.890
Which brings us to the three stages
of demonic activity:

44:38.040 --> 44:40.280
Infestation, oppression and possession.

44:40.440 --> 44:41.810
Now, infestation:

44:41.960 --> 44:45.930
That's the whispering, the footsteps,
the feeling of another presence...

44:46.120 --> 44:49.760
...which ultimately grows
into oppression, the second stage.

44:49.920 --> 44:52.210
Now this is where the victim,
and it's usually the one...

44:52.360 --> 44:54.250
...who's the most
psychologically vulnerable...

44:54.400 --> 44:57.290
...is targeted specifically
by an external force.

44:57.440 --> 45:00.890
Breaks the victim down.
Crushes their will.

45:01.080 --> 45:06.290
And, once in a weakened state, leads them
to the third and final stage: possession.

45:09.440 --> 45:11.010
- Hey, Ed? Lorraine?
- Yeah.

45:11.160 --> 45:13.610
There's someone here
that would like to talk to you.

45:13.760 --> 45:14.810
- Hi.
- Thanks, Drew.

45:14.960 --> 45:16.450
- Thank you.
- I'll see you later.

45:16.600 --> 45:17.680
How can we help you?

45:17.840 --> 45:22.160
There's something horrible happening in
my house. Could you come and take a look?

45:22.440 --> 45:24.280
You know, uh, it's getting kinda late.

45:24.440 --> 45:27.210
- We really need to head to our family.
- You don't understand.

45:27.360 --> 45:30.250
But we do. There's usually some
sort of rational explanation...

45:30.400 --> 45:35.170
I have five daughters who are scared to death.
I'm so afraid this thing wants to hurt us.

45:35.320 --> 45:39.170
You have a daughter. Wouldn't you do
anything you could to protect her? Please.

45:39.320 --> 45:41.530
Please can you come and take a look?

45:42.960 --> 45:44.250
Of course we will.

45:45.120 --> 45:46.610
Of course we will.

45:58.520 --> 46:00.680
Come on, Jan! Open up!

46:02.160 --> 46:03.570
Jan, what happened?

46:04.920 --> 46:06.520
The top of your head turned black.

46:06.680 --> 46:08.440
You guys straighten up? Thanks.

46:08.600 --> 46:10.410
Don't be silly, it's a wig.

46:14.360 --> 46:15.690
- Hello. Hi.
- Hi. Hi.

46:15.840 --> 46:17.250
Thanks for coming.

46:18.040 --> 46:19.720
- Hi, I'm Roger.
- Lorraine.

46:19.920 --> 46:22.210
Hey, nice to meet you, Roger. Ed Warren.

46:22.840 --> 46:24.650
- Thanks for coming.
- Please, come in.

46:24.840 --> 46:26.050
Thank you.

46:27.600 --> 46:28.680
So...

46:28.840 --> 46:31.840
Oh, my God. Look at you all.
Who are these beautiful young women?

46:32.000 --> 46:35.370
This is Andrea, the oldest,
Nancy, Cindy, Christine...

46:35.560 --> 46:37.130
...and April.

46:38.840 --> 46:40.290
It's Mr. and Mrs. Warren.

46:40.880 --> 46:43.570
- We're all sleeping down here now.
- Mm.

46:44.000 --> 46:46.770
The girls feel safer and it's warmer.

46:47.120 --> 46:50.650
I'm constantly turning up the heat,
but the house is always freezing.

46:50.800 --> 46:52.720
It's not a problem with the furnace.

46:52.880 --> 46:54.170
I mean, not that I can find.

46:59.400 --> 47:03.170
It's gotten a lot
worse the past few nights.

47:03.680 --> 47:09.050
There's this awful smell, like rotting meat.
It moves around the house.

47:12.000 --> 47:13.080
Uh...

47:13.240 --> 47:14.450
What? What is it?

47:15.160 --> 47:20.530
Well, rancid smells could indicate
some type of demonic activity.

47:20.760 --> 47:21.840
Oh, my God.

47:26.280 --> 47:28.570
That's to keep those doors
from banging at night.

47:28.720 --> 47:32.170
Otherwise, it's like:
All night long, just like that.

47:33.520 --> 47:35.650
- Does it come in threes?
- Yeah.

47:35.800 --> 47:36.960
It stops at dawn?

47:37.560 --> 47:38.770
Uh-huh.

47:40.760 --> 47:44.050
Well, sometimes it's meant
as an insult to the Trinity:

47:44.200 --> 47:46.170
The Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.

47:47.880 --> 47:51.490
You know, it's the damndest thing,
but we also get all kinds of birds...

47:51.680 --> 47:54.650
...that will just fly against the side
of the house and break their necks.

47:54.800 --> 47:56.450
Hm. Really?

47:56.640 --> 47:59.040
And the clocks stop at 3:07 a.m.

47:59.200 --> 48:01.280
- All of them?
- Every one.

48:04.600 --> 48:07.440
Oh, we were hanging those
along the stairs.

48:07.600 --> 48:11.890
Something just kept knocking them down,
so we stopped hanging them up.

48:15.320 --> 48:17.610
That's what I was talking about.

48:17.920 --> 48:19.680
It was here when we moved in.

48:19.840 --> 48:22.050
There's also a lot of stuff in the cellar.

48:25.120 --> 48:26.450
Show me the cellar.

48:38.560 --> 48:41.170
Look what she made me do.

48:41.400 --> 48:43.800
You picking up anything in here, hon?

48:47.520 --> 48:50.290
Something awful happened here, Ed.

48:54.080 --> 48:57.320
Those bruises, they from something
that happened here?

48:57.480 --> 49:01.530
Oh, it's some iron deficiency thing I have.

49:03.520 --> 49:07.080
You know, with all that's been going on,
why haven't you just moved out?

49:07.400 --> 49:09.370
I don't know where
we'd move to, you know?

49:09.520 --> 49:13.840
We got all our money tied up in this place
and had a lot of repairs on top of that.

49:14.480 --> 49:18.490
And I don't know anybody whose gonna
take in a family of seven indefinitely.

49:18.680 --> 49:20.570
That's why we tracked you down.

49:21.040 --> 49:22.800
We're glad you found us.

49:23.280 --> 49:25.600
All right, let's get started.

49:27.720 --> 49:31.170
My name is Ed Warren.
It's November 1st, 1971.

49:31.360 --> 49:33.360
I'm sitting here with Carolyn Perron...

49:33.520 --> 49:37.730
...who, with her family, has been
experiencing supernatural occurrences.

49:38.640 --> 49:40.130
Okay, go ahead.

49:41.640 --> 49:43.050
Where do I start?

49:43.600 --> 49:45.280
From the first occurrence.

49:46.320 --> 49:48.370
I guess it was the clocks.

49:48.520 --> 49:50.490
Mom and Dad tell me
that you have a friend.

49:50.640 --> 49:52.880
His name's Rory.
He lives here too.

49:53.040 --> 49:54.880
- Hmm.
- But he's always sad.

49:55.040 --> 49:56.090
Why is that?

49:56.240 --> 50:00.040
He won't tell me but I think
something bad happened to him.

50:02.760 --> 50:05.000
Do you mind if I try to see Rory?

51:36.080 --> 51:37.160
Hey.

51:47.920 --> 51:49.210
What is it?

52:10.360 --> 52:14.490
We bought it at auction from the bank, so,
you know, we never knew who lived here.

52:19.160 --> 52:24.370
Well, Lorraine and I both feel that
what your house needs is a cleansing.

52:25.640 --> 52:26.850
An exorcism.

52:28.440 --> 52:29.890
What, exorcism?

52:31.840 --> 52:34.810
I thought that was something
that you do to people.

52:35.000 --> 52:36.370
No, not necessarily, no.

52:37.000 --> 52:38.330
We have to get out of here.

52:38.480 --> 52:40.480
I'm afraid that's not gonna help.

52:42.520 --> 52:44.810
Lorraine saw something, which...

52:44.960 --> 52:46.250
Go ahead, hon.

52:48.680 --> 52:52.050
I've been seeing the dark entity
that haunts your house...

52:52.200 --> 52:53.730
...and your land.

52:58.240 --> 53:01.770
I saw it first when I came
through your door.

53:01.920 --> 53:04.130
It was latched to your back.

53:06.480 --> 53:10.690
And then I saw it again with the girls
when we walked into the living room.

53:11.600 --> 53:13.890
And it doesn't matter where you go...

53:14.080 --> 53:17.210
...this dark entity has latched itself
to your family...

53:17.360 --> 53:18.890
...and it's feeding off you.

53:21.960 --> 53:24.090
Even if we leave?

53:24.240 --> 53:26.930
Sometimes when you get haunted,
it's like stepping on gum.

53:27.480 --> 53:29.370
You take it with you.

53:30.280 --> 53:33.520
Look, I gotta tell you,
you have a lot of spirits in here...

53:33.680 --> 53:38.290
...but this is the one that I'm most
worried about, because it is so hateful.

53:39.040 --> 53:42.010
Okay, so what do we do?
Can we call a priest?

53:42.160 --> 53:43.490
I wish it were that easy.

53:43.640 --> 53:47.650
Performing an exorcism is an archaic
procedure. Requires years of training.

53:48.520 --> 53:52.570
And even then,
I have seen it go horribly wrong.

53:53.520 --> 53:57.240
But before we even get that far,
the church has to authorize it first.

53:57.400 --> 54:00.640
It means we gotta investigate,
gather evidence and provide proof...

54:00.840 --> 54:02.330
...and that's the hard part.

54:04.480 --> 54:06.210
Have your children been baptized?

54:06.360 --> 54:10.680
Uh, no, we never got around to that.
We're not really a churchgoing family.

54:10.920 --> 54:14.530
Well, you may want to rethink that.
Our presence here could make things worse.

54:14.680 --> 54:15.810
Why?

54:15.960 --> 54:17.330
Because we're a threat.

54:17.520 --> 54:20.410
And whatever you're dealing with here
isn't gonna like us.

54:20.560 --> 54:24.120
So far it hasn't done anything violent,
and that's a good sign.

54:24.320 --> 54:27.210
So we're gonna have our guy
do some homework on the property...

54:27.360 --> 54:29.170
...to see what we're up against.

54:31.400 --> 54:33.210
Judy, what are you up to?

54:33.360 --> 54:36.130
- I got you a present.
- Aah.

54:36.280 --> 54:39.360
Me and Nanna got these
at the church's yard sale.

54:39.520 --> 54:41.360
- Honey.
- One for you and one for me.

54:41.520 --> 54:43.090
- Aw.
- She put a picture...

54:43.240 --> 54:44.530
...of you and Daddy in mine.

54:45.040 --> 54:48.200
Nanna said this way
we'll always be together.

54:48.360 --> 54:50.890
You'll be with me and I'll be with you.

54:53.560 --> 54:55.690
I miss you and Daddy.

55:06.320 --> 55:07.450
Hey, hon.

55:09.680 --> 55:10.730
Yup.

55:10.880 --> 55:13.720
You're not gonna believe this.
Carolyn's voice didn't record.

55:15.080 --> 55:16.130
What do you mean?

55:17.080 --> 55:18.290
Listen.

55:18.800 --> 55:22.250
My name is Ed Warren.
It's November 1st, 1971.

55:22.400 --> 55:24.240
I'm sitting here with Carolyn Perron...

55:24.400 --> 55:27.850
...who, with her family, has been
experiencing supernatural occurrences.

55:28.200 --> 55:29.570
Okay, go ahead.

55:32.800 --> 55:34.610
From the first occurrence.

55:38.200 --> 55:39.490
Nothing.

55:40.080 --> 55:41.240
The whole time.

55:41.440 --> 55:43.970
- I don't know. You find anything?
- Lots.

55:44.600 --> 55:47.570
I mean, it's no wonder they're
going through what they are.

55:47.840 --> 55:49.760
That's the original farmhouse.

55:49.920 --> 55:53.000
It was built in 1863 by a man
named Jedson Sherman...

55:53.240 --> 55:55.770
...who was married to a woman
named Bathsheba.

55:56.120 --> 55:59.200
Ed, she's related to Mary Towne Estye.

55:59.360 --> 56:01.560
She was one of the women
accused of witchcraft in Salem.

56:01.680 --> 56:03.600
- She was hung during the trials.
- Wow.

56:03.760 --> 56:06.650
After Bathsheba married Jedson,
they had a baby...

56:06.840 --> 56:08.650
...and when the baby was 7 days old...

56:08.840 --> 56:11.730
...Jedson caught her sacrificing it
in front of the fireplace.

56:11.880 --> 56:13.960
She ran out to that tree by the dock...

56:14.120 --> 56:16.280
...climbed up, proclaimed her love
to Satan...

56:16.440 --> 56:20.330
...cursed anyone who tried
to take her land, and hung herself.

56:22.160 --> 56:25.770
Time of death was pronounced at 3:07
in the morning.

56:26.120 --> 56:27.880
Well, that explains a few things.

56:28.040 --> 56:29.770
Yeah, so does this.

56:30.680 --> 56:33.080
Her last name's Walker.
She lived there in the '30s.

56:33.280 --> 56:36.330
She had a boy named Rory who
mysteriously disappeared in the woods.

56:36.480 --> 56:38.290
Then she killed herself in the cellar.

56:39.320 --> 56:40.370
And that's not all.

56:42.840 --> 56:47.720
So, what was the original 200-acre farm
has since been subdivided and sold off.

56:47.920 --> 56:51.890
There was another boy who drowned in
a pond here. He lived in a house over here.

56:52.040 --> 56:56.170
And a woman who worked as a maid in a
neighboring home, she committed suicide too.

56:58.080 --> 56:59.920
People who took her land.

57:01.520 --> 57:03.810
I'm sitting here with Carolyn Perron...

57:03.960 --> 57:07.170
...who, with her family, has been
experiencing supernatural occurrences.

57:08.680 --> 57:10.090
Okay, go ahead.

57:13.240 --> 57:15.370
From the first occurrence.

57:50.800 --> 57:52.040
Here's Brad.

57:55.960 --> 57:57.450
- You find it okay?
- Oh, yeah.

57:57.600 --> 57:58.970
Drew, this is Officer Brad.

57:59.160 --> 58:01.690
Officer Brad Hamilton,
Harrisville, Rhode Island P.D.

58:01.840 --> 58:03.730
Hm. Nice to meet you, man.

58:04.080 --> 58:07.720
- So you're the lucky new cop, huh?
- Guess so.

58:07.920 --> 58:11.050
- You know you can't shoot ghosts, right?
- Take it easy on him, Drew.

58:11.200 --> 58:13.440
All right, guys,
help me get this stuff unloaded.

58:14.640 --> 58:16.090
You take this.

58:17.240 --> 58:18.400
Hi, Roger.

58:22.960 --> 58:27.920
All right. When you're finished here, why
don't you hit upstairs, all right, Drew?

58:28.080 --> 58:29.290
You got it.

58:52.040 --> 58:53.690
What's wrong with the Chevy?

58:54.280 --> 58:56.280
Ugh, what's not wrong with her?

58:56.440 --> 58:58.600
- Needs a new carburetor to start.
- Oh, yeah?

58:58.800 --> 59:01.880
Kind of put fixing her up
on hold for a while.

59:02.040 --> 59:03.490
Yeah. Ahem.

59:05.440 --> 59:07.520
Hey, Brad, hand me a thermostat,
would you?

59:09.840 --> 59:12.160
What's this, uh, do?

59:12.680 --> 59:14.490
When there's an instant drop
in temperature...

59:14.640 --> 59:17.090
...the thermostat
triggers the camera to take a picture.

59:17.520 --> 59:19.570
You've actually caught things on film?

59:19.960 --> 59:22.530
Well, yeah, that's, uh, the point.

59:23.160 --> 59:26.240
Why, uh...? Why out here?

59:26.440 --> 59:29.170
Well, this is where the witch
committed suicide.

59:29.800 --> 59:33.960
She hung herself from that branch
right above where you're standing.

59:40.480 --> 59:42.360
How could a
mother kill her own child?

59:43.040 --> 59:44.930
It was never a child to her.

59:45.080 --> 59:48.720
She just used her God-given gift
as the ultimate offense against him.

59:48.880 --> 59:51.960
Witches believe it elevates their status
in the eyes of Satan.

1:00:00.720 --> 1:00:01.880
Mm.

1:00:02.040 --> 1:00:05.520
Wow.
That's a nice day at the beach, huh?

1:00:05.680 --> 1:00:07.490
How did you know?

1:00:07.680 --> 1:00:12.210
It's an insight. It's like a peek through
the curtain into another person's life.

1:00:14.600 --> 1:00:16.050
Mm.

1:00:16.400 --> 1:00:20.450
That day meant so much to me.
We were driving along the coast.

1:00:20.600 --> 1:00:23.210
Nancy pointed out
how pretty the view was.

1:00:23.800 --> 1:00:26.720
I thought this is a perfect opportunity
for a photo.

1:00:26.880 --> 1:00:30.040
We're gonna start fresh, you know?
A new house, a new beginning.

1:00:30.200 --> 1:00:33.570
You should have seen Roger and the girls.
I've never seen them so happy.

1:00:33.720 --> 1:00:34.880
Cheese!

1:00:36.520 --> 1:00:38.650
They mean the world to me.

1:00:49.240 --> 1:00:51.080
Put your hand flat on the desk.

1:00:52.560 --> 1:00:54.450
Yeah, and take it off.

1:00:56.960 --> 1:00:58.410
Here we go.

1:01:03.840 --> 1:01:04.890
See?

1:01:05.040 --> 1:01:07.410
It just reveals to us what
the naked eye can't see.

1:01:07.600 --> 1:01:09.090
Pretty far out, isn't it?

1:01:09.960 --> 1:01:11.690
Yeah, it's groovy.

1:01:17.440 --> 1:01:19.570
Drew, you got the Bolex ready for Brad?

1:01:19.760 --> 1:01:22.080
Yeah, already locked and loaded, sir.

1:01:39.680 --> 1:01:42.130
What? I had to go.

1:02:05.240 --> 1:02:07.810
All the rooms are
coming in pretty good.

1:02:07.960 --> 1:02:09.200
Good.

1:02:14.640 --> 1:02:16.170
What's in the bottle?

1:02:16.960 --> 1:02:18.010
Holy water.

1:02:20.240 --> 1:02:22.560
Presence of religious icons...

1:02:22.720 --> 1:02:25.770
...will get a reaction
from anything unholy.

1:02:27.480 --> 1:02:29.210
Sort of pisses them off.

1:02:30.520 --> 1:02:34.000
So I set these throughout the house,
see if I can stir things up a bit.

1:02:36.880 --> 1:02:40.680
- Like holding a cross to a vampire?
- Yeah. Exactly.

1:02:41.040 --> 1:02:43.200
Except I don't believe in vampires.

1:02:48.280 --> 1:02:49.520
Wasn't me.

1:03:04.040 --> 1:03:05.530
Brad, get the camera.

1:03:09.360 --> 1:03:10.440
Okay.

1:03:16.720 --> 1:03:21.200
All right, it's 9:18, we're headed down into the
cellar where the door's just opened on its own.

1:03:21.400 --> 1:03:24.210
I have Lorraine and Officer Brad Hamilton
with me.

1:03:24.440 --> 1:03:26.570
Let's keep the cellar light off.

1:03:40.560 --> 1:03:43.400
Give us a sign that you wanna
communicate with us.

1:04:11.920 --> 1:04:13.450
Hon, you all right?

1:04:17.800 --> 1:04:20.250
There's definitely something here.

1:04:21.640 --> 1:04:24.770
- All right, close the door. Move something.
- My hands are so cold.

1:04:27.120 --> 1:04:28.330
Come on.

1:04:33.480 --> 1:04:34.640
No.

1:04:34.800 --> 1:04:36.450
It's gone. It's gone.

1:04:36.640 --> 1:04:38.130
I got nothing.

1:04:38.440 --> 1:04:39.770
Okay.

1:05:00.360 --> 1:05:03.810
Well, like I said, it doesn't
always work when you want it to.

1:05:04.320 --> 1:05:06.770
Yeah, maybe the camera picked
something up.

1:05:07.560 --> 1:05:08.850
Watch out!

1:05:12.640 --> 1:05:14.170
For a guy who doesn't believe...

1:05:14.320 --> 1:05:17.690
...you looked a little freaked out
when that door slammed shut.

1:05:20.560 --> 1:05:22.610
It must have been a draft.

1:05:23.080 --> 1:05:24.810
Oh, that's funny.

1:05:25.320 --> 1:05:27.930
A draft never put that look
on my face before.

1:05:30.600 --> 1:05:32.360
I believe the clock.

1:05:34.000 --> 1:05:35.600
It's 3:08.

1:05:45.800 --> 1:05:47.370
Let me see your glasses.

1:05:47.680 --> 1:05:48.730
For you.

1:05:48.920 --> 1:05:52.640
I think I might take some girls for ice cream later on.
What do you say about that?

1:05:52.840 --> 1:05:55.000
- Yeah!
- Honey, you wanna come?

1:05:55.160 --> 1:05:58.210
I'm exhausted. I'm just gonna take a nap.
The late nights are getting to me.

1:05:58.360 --> 1:06:00.760
That's probably a good idea.
Why don't you get some rest.

1:06:00.960 --> 1:06:03.570
- Lorraine and I'll watch over things for a bit.
- Really?

1:06:03.720 --> 1:06:06.450
I'm gonna take off.
I have a shift starting in an hour.

1:06:06.600 --> 1:06:08.760
The house hasn't felt like this
in a long time.

1:06:08.960 --> 1:06:11.880
I think the kids feel a lot safer
with you around.

1:06:15.440 --> 1:06:17.890
- I could get used to this.
- What, me doing laundry?

1:06:20.000 --> 1:06:21.840
- Ha-ha-ha.
- You're funny.

1:06:22.480 --> 1:06:24.010
No, this place.

1:06:24.400 --> 1:06:26.480
Nice, fresh country air.

1:06:30.280 --> 1:06:32.850
They have such a beautiful family,
don't they?

1:06:33.000 --> 1:06:37.480
Yeah, that little one, April,
did you see her bring me pancakes?

1:06:42.920 --> 1:06:44.520
We've gotta help them.

1:06:45.000 --> 1:06:46.410
I know.

1:06:47.600 --> 1:06:50.080
- I'll start with the Chevy.
- Heh.

1:08:12.240 --> 1:08:13.530
Carolyn!

1:08:14.560 --> 1:08:15.610
Are you okay?

1:08:15.760 --> 1:08:16.920
Carolyn, open the door.

1:08:17.080 --> 1:08:18.160
Carolyn, open up!

1:08:25.160 --> 1:08:26.210
Are you okay?

1:08:26.360 --> 1:08:27.650
- Oh, I'm fine.
- Are you sick?

1:08:27.800 --> 1:08:30.640
- I woke up feeling nauseous, that's all.
- I thought I saw...

1:08:30.800 --> 1:08:33.040
I hear Roger and the girls.

1:08:33.200 --> 1:08:34.280
One minute.

1:08:46.520 --> 1:08:48.650
- Guys, do you wanna play a game?
- Boring!

1:08:48.800 --> 1:08:49.930
Thank you, Daddy.

1:08:51.200 --> 1:08:52.360
Let's go inside.

1:08:56.640 --> 1:08:57.840
I thought that was you.

1:08:58.000 --> 1:08:59.210
Hey, I hope you don't mind.

1:08:59.400 --> 1:09:02.050
I got a good deal on a rebuild
at that wrecking yard in Smithfield.

1:09:02.240 --> 1:09:05.290
- No, you look like you know what you're doing.
- Yeah, we'll see.

1:09:08.240 --> 1:09:09.890
Got a nice place here, Roger.

1:09:10.080 --> 1:09:12.400
Lorraine and I always wanted
a spot in the country.

1:09:12.560 --> 1:09:13.890
I'll sell you this one.

1:09:16.080 --> 1:09:17.610
Hey, hand me a wrench, would you?

1:09:20.240 --> 1:09:24.690
Hey, uh, it really means a lot
to us to have you here.

1:09:24.840 --> 1:09:27.920
I gotta admit, I was a little
bit skeptical going in.

1:09:29.120 --> 1:09:32.280
Just wanna say thank you, though,
for coming out when you did.

1:09:34.080 --> 1:09:37.690
I can't take the credit.
That's, uh... That's all Lorraine.

1:09:37.840 --> 1:09:40.610
- I didn't want to.
- Oh. Why's that?

1:09:43.920 --> 1:09:47.320
Whatever Lorraine sees, feels, touches,
it helps people.

1:09:47.480 --> 1:09:49.610
But it also takes a toll on her.

1:09:49.840 --> 1:09:51.210
Little piece each time.

1:09:55.160 --> 1:09:57.890
Couple months ago
we were working on a case.

1:09:59.440 --> 1:10:01.170
She saw something.

1:10:11.680 --> 1:10:13.210
It took a real big piece.

1:10:15.120 --> 1:10:16.650
When we got home...

1:10:16.840 --> 1:10:19.840
...she went into our room,
locked herself in...

1:10:20.000 --> 1:10:22.840
...didn't talk, didn't eat,
didn't come out for eight days.

1:10:23.800 --> 1:10:25.130
What'd she see?

1:10:28.080 --> 1:10:29.320
Get out of here!

1:10:30.400 --> 1:10:31.640
I don't know.

1:10:32.160 --> 1:10:33.810
And I won't ask.

1:10:51.400 --> 1:10:54.560
I need to reload. You want some?

1:10:55.040 --> 1:10:56.570
I'm good, thanks.

1:10:57.400 --> 1:10:58.690
All right.

1:11:43.400 --> 1:11:45.240
Look what she made me do.

1:12:28.920 --> 1:12:31.240
Look what she made me do.

1:12:34.080 --> 1:12:35.290
Hey.

1:12:42.720 --> 1:12:43.770
Ed?

1:12:43.960 --> 1:12:45.170
Look what she made me do!

1:12:47.360 --> 1:12:48.960
Ed! Ed!

1:12:49.600 --> 1:12:50.840
Ed!

1:12:51.960 --> 1:12:53.170
Dude, you okay?

1:12:53.320 --> 1:12:54.810
Hold up, Brad. What's going on?

1:12:54.960 --> 1:12:57.880
I saw someone. There was
a woman dressed as a maid.

1:13:01.560 --> 1:13:03.530
Ed? Ed, we're getting something.

1:13:08.800 --> 1:13:11.640
- It's just Cindy. She's sleepwalking.
- No, wait. We need this.

1:13:11.800 --> 1:13:13.400
Why do we need pictures of Cindy?

1:13:14.320 --> 1:13:15.850
She didn't trigger it.

1:13:16.000 --> 1:13:19.320
- What do you mean she didn't trigger it?
- Somebody's with her.

1:13:22.480 --> 1:13:23.640
Who?

1:13:27.560 --> 1:13:28.930
Cindy!

1:13:32.640 --> 1:13:33.930
Cindy!

1:13:40.680 --> 1:13:42.090
Cindy!

1:13:42.240 --> 1:13:43.890
Hey, over here. It's safe.

1:13:44.040 --> 1:13:45.930
There's someone else in there with her.

1:13:47.200 --> 1:13:49.520
I'm hearing another voice. Here, listen.

1:13:54.320 --> 1:13:56.530
Follow me. This way.

1:13:58.000 --> 1:13:59.810
This is where I hide.

1:14:04.960 --> 1:14:06.200
Cindy?

1:14:08.720 --> 1:14:10.050
Cindy?

1:14:11.880 --> 1:14:13.040
Where'd she go, Ed?

1:14:13.440 --> 1:14:15.040
Windows are locked.

1:14:18.080 --> 1:14:20.050
Ed, where'd she go?

1:14:21.560 --> 1:14:22.930
Brad, get the UV light.

1:14:23.080 --> 1:14:25.240
- The what?
- Just ask Drew.

1:14:26.360 --> 1:14:29.170
- Drew, I need a UV light.
- Uh...

1:14:29.320 --> 1:14:30.850
Here, that's it. Go, go, go, go!

1:14:37.400 --> 1:14:38.930
Turn off the light.

1:14:42.560 --> 1:14:44.130
Get out of the way.

1:14:47.280 --> 1:14:48.410
Okay.

1:15:17.680 --> 1:15:19.210
Hit the lights!

1:15:31.280 --> 1:15:32.770
Found her.

1:15:34.400 --> 1:15:35.450
Here we go.

1:15:36.040 --> 1:15:38.280
- All right. You got her?
- Yeah.

1:15:50.000 --> 1:15:53.050
That's where Rory hides
when he's afraid.

1:16:18.840 --> 1:16:21.760
Hon? Could I have April's
music box, please?

1:16:24.840 --> 1:16:27.570
- How's Cindy?
- She doesn't remember a thing.

1:16:30.520 --> 1:16:31.850
Here you go.

1:16:32.600 --> 1:16:33.890
Thank you.

1:17:11.520 --> 1:17:12.890
Lorraine!

1:17:16.960 --> 1:17:18.200
No.

1:17:31.080 --> 1:17:32.320
Lorraine!

1:17:32.560 --> 1:17:33.800
Lorraine!

1:17:38.160 --> 1:17:39.570
Lorraine!

1:17:40.360 --> 1:17:41.770
Lorraine!

1:18:32.920 --> 1:18:35.650
She made me do it.

1:18:36.720 --> 1:18:39.290
She made me do it.

1:19:00.960 --> 1:19:03.610
She made me do it.

1:19:47.320 --> 1:19:48.370
Ed!

1:19:48.560 --> 1:19:50.370
Come on! Lorraine!

1:19:58.200 --> 1:19:59.330
Ed!

1:20:00.200 --> 1:20:01.880
Ed, I know what she did.

1:20:02.080 --> 1:20:04.650
- I got you. I know. It's okay.
- I know what she did.

1:20:04.800 --> 1:20:07.720
I know what she did. She possessed
the mother to kill the child.

1:20:07.880 --> 1:20:09.410
She visits Carolyn every night.

1:20:09.560 --> 1:20:12.400
That's what the bruise marks are!
She's feeding off of her!

1:20:25.520 --> 1:20:27.090
Uh...

1:20:27.320 --> 1:20:28.770
Nancy?

1:20:33.240 --> 1:20:34.480
Nancy!

1:20:34.880 --> 1:20:36.170
Are you okay?

1:20:36.760 --> 1:20:38.090
Nancy!

1:20:39.600 --> 1:20:40.650
Grab her!

1:20:43.160 --> 1:20:44.730
Daddy! Help!

1:20:45.600 --> 1:20:46.680
Nancy!

1:20:53.920 --> 1:20:55.000
Is she okay?

1:20:55.200 --> 1:20:56.410
It's okay, I got you.

1:20:56.560 --> 1:20:57.610
Did you get that?

1:20:59.880 --> 1:21:01.090
Yeah.

1:21:04.240 --> 1:21:07.240
I'll have the footage developed
and get it over to Father Gordon.

1:21:07.400 --> 1:21:11.410
He's our liaison at the church.
I imagine we'll get a pretty fast response.

1:21:11.560 --> 1:21:13.610
- Listen, Roger?
- Yeah?

1:21:13.800 --> 1:21:16.960
Listen, when we get the exorcist,
I'll be back. But Lorraine...

1:21:17.120 --> 1:21:20.200
- Yeah, I understand.
- Until then Drew's gonna keep an eye on you.

1:21:20.360 --> 1:21:22.730
- Hey, Ed, thank you for everything.
- Yeah.

1:21:24.160 --> 1:21:25.450
Mommy?

1:21:27.760 --> 1:21:29.410
That's everything.

1:21:41.320 --> 1:21:42.690
Mommy?

1:22:01.000 --> 1:22:02.130
Judy?

1:22:02.440 --> 1:22:03.810
Oh, God!

1:22:03.960 --> 1:22:05.090
Judy?

1:22:13.760 --> 1:22:15.680
Lorraine! Wait!

1:22:17.280 --> 1:22:18.810
Lorraine. What?

1:22:18.960 --> 1:22:20.330
Mom, it's me. Is Judy okay?

1:22:20.480 --> 1:22:22.960
- What?
- Can you go check, please?

1:22:23.520 --> 1:22:25.200
Damn it, Mom, just check, please!

1:22:25.360 --> 1:22:28.200
- Are you gonna tell me what's going on?
- It's Judy.

1:22:28.360 --> 1:22:29.890
What? What do you mean?

1:22:30.880 --> 1:22:32.010
What?

1:22:33.360 --> 1:22:35.520
Oh, thank God.

1:22:36.160 --> 1:22:39.370
Mom, I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to scare you. I'll explain later, okay?

1:22:41.000 --> 1:22:42.330
What the hell happened?

1:22:42.480 --> 1:22:45.960
I had a vision of Judy in the water.

1:22:46.120 --> 1:22:48.410
I know it was some kind of warning.

1:22:49.640 --> 1:22:51.130
I know it.

1:22:51.280 --> 1:22:52.520
Okay.

1:22:54.560 --> 1:22:55.890
Let's get out of here.

1:23:43.880 --> 1:23:46.360
- So?
- Yeah, well, you weren't kidding.

1:23:46.520 --> 1:23:47.600
No.

1:23:48.400 --> 1:23:52.560
Look, Ed, this is complicated
because the kids aren't baptized.

1:23:52.720 --> 1:23:55.960
- No, I understand.
- And the family are not members of the church.

1:23:56.120 --> 1:23:57.450
- Oh, come on.
- And...

1:23:58.280 --> 1:24:01.760
The approval would have to come
directly from the Vatican.

1:24:03.120 --> 1:24:06.040
Father, we've never seen nothing like this.

1:24:09.920 --> 1:24:12.650
Yeah, well, neither have I.

1:24:21.360 --> 1:24:23.250
Father, they don't have a lot of time.

1:24:23.840 --> 1:24:25.080
All right.

1:24:26.560 --> 1:24:28.160
I'll push it through myself.

1:24:28.320 --> 1:24:30.290
- Thank you, Father. Thank you.
- Thank you.

1:24:30.840 --> 1:24:33.760
- All right, we'll wait for your call.
- Yeah.

1:25:37.560 --> 1:25:39.720
Mommy? Daddy?

1:25:57.160 --> 1:25:58.570
Mommy?

1:25:59.080 --> 1:26:00.410
Daddy?

1:26:24.080 --> 1:26:25.610
Dad?

1:26:41.920 --> 1:26:43.370
Nanna?

1:26:44.600 --> 1:26:46.010
Nanna?

1:26:59.000 --> 1:27:00.290
Aah!

1:27:40.320 --> 1:27:41.850
Nanna!

1:27:42.040 --> 1:27:44.850
Nanna, help! Nanna, help!

1:27:45.000 --> 1:27:46.050
Judy?

1:27:46.200 --> 1:27:46.700
Nanna!

1:27:51.040 --> 1:27:52.330
Help!

1:27:52.760 --> 1:27:54.360
- Judy!
- Nanna!

1:27:54.560 --> 1:27:56.370
- Judy, open the door!
- Mom!

1:27:58.360 --> 1:28:00.360
- Ed, there's something wrong.
- What?

1:28:03.560 --> 1:28:04.640
Nanna!

1:28:05.200 --> 1:28:06.880
- Judy!
- Help!

1:28:07.040 --> 1:28:09.200
- Judy! Judy, open this door!
- What is it?

1:28:09.360 --> 1:28:12.490
- What's wrong with her? Judy!
- Hey, move. Move, move, move, move.

1:28:12.680 --> 1:28:14.280
Judy, get back, honey. Get back!

1:28:14.800 --> 1:28:16.170
- Come on!
- Hurry.

1:28:16.880 --> 1:28:18.800
Help! Help!

1:28:19.520 --> 1:28:21.090
Get away from the door, Judy!

1:28:24.080 --> 1:28:25.970
Aah!

1:28:26.120 --> 1:28:27.800
Oh, God! Are you okay?

1:28:27.960 --> 1:28:32.050
There was someone rocking
in the chair with Annabelle.

1:28:35.120 --> 1:28:36.250
What?

1:28:39.480 --> 1:28:40.720
It's okay.

1:29:00.640 --> 1:29:02.090
She's still in the case.

1:29:04.880 --> 1:29:05.930
It's okay.

1:29:07.200 --> 1:29:08.770
It's okay. It's okay.

1:29:14.280 --> 1:29:16.680
- Dad! Dad!
- Daddy!

1:29:16.840 --> 1:29:19.210
Dad! Dad! Mom just left
with Christine and April.

1:29:19.360 --> 1:29:21.840
She went in the car and drove away.
I don't know what happened.

1:29:22.000 --> 1:29:24.640
- She smells like rotting meat.
- She didn't say what was going on.

1:29:24.680 --> 1:29:28.290
- What do you mean, she left? Left where?
- Gone! I don't know where she was going.

1:29:33.640 --> 1:29:35.370
Where are we going, Mom?

1:29:43.960 --> 1:29:45.250
- Hello?
- It's Roger.

1:29:45.440 --> 1:29:46.770
Somethings going on with Carolyn.

1:29:46.960 --> 1:29:49.800
Andrea was here, said Carolyn took
off with Christine and April.

1:29:49.960 --> 1:29:52.800
- The girls said she smelled like rotten meat.
- Possesses the mother...

1:29:52.880 --> 1:29:55.650
...to kill the child, that's what she does.
She's taking them to the house.

1:29:55.800 --> 1:29:57.680
Roger, get back to the house now.
I'll meet you.

1:29:57.800 --> 1:30:01.250
Lock the door, close the blinds.
Stay off the phone!

1:30:02.400 --> 1:30:03.610
Go.

1:30:08.960 --> 1:30:10.800
- I'm coming.
- No, you stay with Judy.

1:30:10.920 --> 1:30:13.320
Only way to protect Judy
is if we stop this where it started.

1:30:13.480 --> 1:30:16.610
Otherwise, she'll latch onto us again.
- That's exactly why I am going.

1:30:16.800 --> 1:30:19.410
You think I'm gonna let you walk
into this alone?

1:30:20.080 --> 1:30:21.410
I can't lose you.

1:30:22.000 --> 1:30:23.240
You won't.

1:30:24.320 --> 1:30:26.080
Let's finish this together.

1:30:44.920 --> 1:30:47.610
- Agh! It's locked.
- Carolyn!

1:30:48.160 --> 1:30:49.210
Roger!

1:30:49.360 --> 1:30:50.490
Get out of the way!

1:30:56.720 --> 1:30:58.370
- Roger!
- Ed!

1:30:58.520 --> 1:31:00.120
- Carolyn!
- Ed!

1:31:01.280 --> 1:31:02.680
- Carolyn!
- We're down here!

1:31:02.720 --> 1:31:05.560
Carolyn, don't!
No, no! She's got...!

1:31:05.720 --> 1:31:07.850
Get her hand! Get the scissors!

1:31:19.080 --> 1:31:21.450
- We gotta get her to the car!
- And bring her where?

1:31:21.640 --> 1:31:23.610
To take her to the priest
for the exorcism.

1:31:23.800 --> 1:31:25.170
- Where's April?
- April?

1:31:27.520 --> 1:31:28.810
April!

1:31:29.480 --> 1:31:31.690
Take Christine to the car and find April!

1:31:31.880 --> 1:31:32.930
April!

1:31:34.080 --> 1:31:35.370
Come on!

1:31:45.680 --> 1:31:47.880
- She won't let her leave the house.
- What do you mean?

1:31:47.920 --> 1:31:50.320
- If we take her out, the witch will kill her.
- Agh!

1:31:56.920 --> 1:31:59.690
Roger!

1:31:59.840 --> 1:32:01.210
Carolyn!

1:32:01.560 --> 1:32:02.610
Go!

1:32:02.760 --> 1:32:03.840
Carolyn?

1:32:09.200 --> 1:32:11.440
Okay, I'm gonna put you in here.
Come on.

1:32:11.600 --> 1:32:14.250
- Get in. Stay in here.
- I don't wanna stay here by myself.

1:32:14.400 --> 1:32:16.210
Stay in here no matter what.
I'll be back.

1:32:16.360 --> 1:32:18.810
I have to find April, okay?
I'll be back, I promise.

1:32:21.760 --> 1:32:22.920
April?

1:32:25.880 --> 1:32:27.120
You Okay?

1:32:32.040 --> 1:32:33.280
Stop!

1:32:36.760 --> 1:32:38.840
Brad! Brad!

1:32:42.720 --> 1:32:44.290
Aah!

1:32:52.640 --> 1:32:54.480
Let's get something to tie her up!

1:33:02.080 --> 1:33:03.450
Hold it.

1:33:14.240 --> 1:33:16.930
I gotta call Father Gordon.
We gotta get him out here.

1:33:17.080 --> 1:33:19.450
He's too far away.
She won't make it. Look at her.

1:33:30.080 --> 1:33:32.530
- Then you need to leave.
- What are you talking about?

1:33:32.840 --> 1:33:34.810
I have to do it. The exorcism.

1:33:35.280 --> 1:33:38.200
What? I thought you said we
need a priest. You're not a priest.

1:33:38.400 --> 1:33:40.850
- Well, you got a better idea?
- He can do it.

1:33:41.920 --> 1:33:44.130
- You can do it.
- But you gotta get out of here.

1:33:44.280 --> 1:33:47.890
- I'm not leaving you!
- Damn it, I'm not doing this with you in here!

1:33:49.720 --> 1:33:52.960
God brought us together for a reason.
This is it.

1:33:53.920 --> 1:33:55.570
I'm gonna get the book.

1:34:12.160 --> 1:34:13.530
April!

1:34:22.400 --> 1:34:23.770
April!

1:34:45.400 --> 1:34:49.120
"In the name of the Father,
the Son, the Holy Spirit."

1:35:28.800 --> 1:35:29.960
April!

1:36:29.880 --> 1:36:31.960
Hold her still! Hold her still!

1:36:32.120 --> 1:36:33.880
Come here! Hold her still!

1:36:42.720 --> 1:36:43.960
April?

1:36:50.840 --> 1:36:51.890
April!

1:36:52.040 --> 1:36:53.610
April, you under there?

1:36:55.000 --> 1:36:56.080
April!

1:37:01.720 --> 1:37:04.720
Carolyn. Carolyn. Don't give in!
Don't let her take you!

1:37:04.920 --> 1:37:06.970
Ed! You gotta stop,
you're killing her. Stop!

1:37:07.120 --> 1:37:08.490
No, he can't!

1:37:09.440 --> 1:37:13.330
Roger, help me!

1:37:18.240 --> 1:37:20.240
Ed! Goddamn it, stop it!

1:37:20.400 --> 1:37:22.850
Understand this! We are
now fighting for her soul!

1:37:23.000 --> 1:37:26.240
"In the name of Jesus Christ,
the saints and all the angels...

1:37:26.440 --> 1:37:28.520
...I command you to reveal yourself!"

1:37:57.920 --> 1:38:00.490
Roger, help me!

1:38:51.720 --> 1:38:53.130
Put her down!

1:38:54.080 --> 1:38:55.290
Put her down!

1:38:57.480 --> 1:38:58.560
Put her down!

1:39:00.440 --> 1:39:01.650
Carolyn!

1:39:01.880 --> 1:39:03.170
Carolyn!

1:39:05.840 --> 1:39:08.000
- Ed, look out!
- Unh!

1:39:11.440 --> 1:39:12.970
Are you okay?

1:39:14.960 --> 1:39:16.930
Hold her still! Don't let her up!

1:39:17.080 --> 1:39:18.490
We're losing her, Roger!

1:39:18.680 --> 1:39:21.210
Damn you! You leave my family alone,
you hear me?

1:39:21.360 --> 1:39:24.010
I don't know what you are, but you leave
my wife alone, goddamn it!

1:39:24.160 --> 1:39:27.160
Let her go!
Do you hear me? Let her go!

1:39:29.560 --> 1:39:31.960
Let her go, goddamn it! Let her go!

1:39:38.320 --> 1:39:40.480
She's already gone.

1:39:41.200 --> 1:39:43.330
And now you're all gonna die.

1:39:50.800 --> 1:39:51.880
April!

1:39:52.040 --> 1:39:55.930
I found her! She's under the house!
Under the kitchen!

1:39:57.440 --> 1:39:58.520
Don't! No!

1:39:59.360 --> 1:40:00.690
Get her!

1:40:15.080 --> 1:40:16.530
- Here.
- Carolyn!

1:40:19.280 --> 1:40:21.410
- Carolyn!
- She's in that hole. Right there.

1:40:24.000 --> 1:40:26.130
Carolyn? Oh, my God. No!

1:40:26.280 --> 1:40:29.010
Can't go in. Can't reach.

1:40:29.440 --> 1:40:30.680
No! Carolyn, don't!

1:40:33.080 --> 1:40:34.410
Carolyn, no!

1:40:34.680 --> 1:40:36.570
Bathsheba!

1:40:38.920 --> 1:40:42.970
By the power of God,
I condemn you back to hell!

1:40:45.440 --> 1:40:46.930
This is your daughter!

1:40:49.080 --> 1:40:51.770
- You can't give in!
- Agh!

1:40:51.920 --> 1:40:54.160
Roger. We need to get her
to fight from the inside.

1:40:54.320 --> 1:40:56.890
Don't let her do this.
Don't let this thing do this.

1:40:57.040 --> 1:40:59.280
You gotta fight it.
You're stronger than she is.

1:40:59.440 --> 1:41:01.330
- You gotta fight!
- Keep it going, Roger!

1:41:01.480 --> 1:41:04.250
You gotta stay with us, all right?
Come on back, Carolyn.

1:41:04.800 --> 1:41:06.290
You're in, that's it! Get her back!

1:41:06.440 --> 1:41:09.090
- Remember what you showed me.
- No!

1:41:11.000 --> 1:41:13.480
Remember that day that you said
you would never forget.

1:41:23.200 --> 1:41:25.570
You said they
meant the world to you.

1:41:26.120 --> 1:41:28.330
This is what you'll be leaving behind.

1:42:07.200 --> 1:42:08.490
Mommy?

1:42:36.120 --> 1:42:37.490
Oh.

1:42:41.720 --> 1:42:43.210
It's over.

1:42:43.680 --> 1:42:45.280
I am so sorry.

1:42:45.440 --> 1:42:49.450
I love you so much. I love you so much.

1:42:49.640 --> 1:42:50.970
I love you so much.

1:42:52.320 --> 1:42:53.920
I'm so happy.

1:43:15.880 --> 1:43:17.610
A draft do that to your face?

1:43:18.400 --> 1:43:20.480
I'd take a guy with a gun any day.

1:43:24.680 --> 1:43:26.210
You did good.

1:43:26.640 --> 1:43:28.050
No, you did.

1:44:28.680 --> 1:44:31.810
I'll call Father Gordon
and let him know what happened.

1:44:32.720 --> 1:44:34.290
Sounds good.

1:44:59.520 --> 1:45:02.130
The Vatican approved the exorcism.

1:45:02.440 --> 1:45:04.440
Heh. Nice timing.

1:45:06.040 --> 1:45:09.730
And if we can, then he'd like
to meet with us tomorrow.

1:45:09.880 --> 1:45:12.410
There's a case in Long Island
he'd like to discuss.

1:45:12.560 --> 1:45:13.640
Really?
