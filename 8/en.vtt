[in Pashto]

02:23.435 --> 02:25.342
[shouting in Pashto]

02:42.891 --> 02:46.121
You would have thought
one example
would be enough for them.

02:47.561 --> 02:49.366
Let's see
if you can convince them.

02:53.805 --> 02:56.538
[grunts, pants]

03:35.340 --> 03:39.174
[in Pashto]

04:07.339 --> 04:08.445
Pick it up.

04:14.719 --> 04:16.013
Now.

04:24.225 --> 04:25.363

06:12.498 --> 06:13.636
Don't leave them!

06:14.267 --> 06:15.234
Stop!

06:15.336 --> 06:16.870
Stop, you hear me?

06:17.603 --> 06:18.967
Don't you leave them!

06:18.968 --> 06:21.875
Get the fuck back down there,
you hear me!

06:22.649 --> 06:23.745
Stop!

06:25.344 --> 06:26.484
No.

06:31.286 --> 06:32.721
[gunshot]
No!

07:07.524 --> 07:10.189
I'm sorry,
but he was really short.

07:10.190 --> 07:11.386
I know, right!

07:12.691 --> 07:14.796
[chattering continues]

07:20.073 --> 07:21.806
You want to hear
the latest?

07:21.908 --> 07:23.107
Another proposal?

07:23.210 --> 07:25.472
Now you're just bragging.
[laughs]

07:25.574 --> 07:27.368
Our butcher
came to my father

07:27.369 --> 07:30.209
and offered him
my weight in beef
to marry his son.

07:30.210 --> 07:31.377
[friend] Whoo!

07:31.378 --> 07:33.785
So, like a dozen patties?

07:33.887 --> 07:35.219
Exactly! [laughs]

07:35.220 --> 07:37.322
Wait, McDonald's
for the reception?

07:37.424 --> 07:39.053
Get me a Big Mac
and I'll marry your butcher.

07:39.054 --> 07:40.422
[laughs]
Oh!

07:40.423 --> 07:42.084
That's why they call it
a happy meal.

07:42.186 --> 07:44.461
- And for fries?
- For fries, I would--

07:44.563 --> 07:46.762
- [gunfire in distance]
- [shouting in distance]

07:55.808 --> 07:57.399
Taliban.

07:57.400 --> 07:58.774
ISIS.

08:01.443 --> 08:03.405
[shouting in Pashto]

08:14.085 --> 08:16.660
- [gunshots]
- [students screaming]

08:22.266 --> 08:24.133
Out! Out! Out! Out!

08:24.235 --> 08:26.329
[screaming continues]

08:31.010 --> 08:32.337
Fuck going down!

08:32.439 --> 08:33.701
The roof.

08:33.803 --> 08:34.942
Go, go, go!

08:36.280 --> 08:37.681
[gunshots continue]

[soldier shouting in Pashto]

09:39.572 --> 09:40.612
[in Pashto]

09:51.315 --> 09:53.383
Which one is
the whore Durani's daughter?

10:00.161 --> 10:03.030
Which one of you is
the daughter of Camila Durani?

10:03.730 --> 10:04.926
Traitor to her people.

10:05.028 --> 10:06.103
She wasn't here today.

10:06.205 --> 10:07.236
She called in sick.

10:07.338 --> 10:09.432
[students screaming]

10:14.940 --> 10:16.307
[soldier shouts in Pashto]

10:20.716 --> 10:22.614
They're going to
come up here.

10:22.716 --> 10:24.755
Car park.
I can drive.

10:39.535 --> 10:41.464

10:53.085 --> 10:54.015
[in Pashto]

11:09.101 --> 11:10.328
[gun clicks]

11:17.772 --> 11:19.502
He's coming. He's coming.

11:25.408 --> 11:27.543
You are the daughter
of the whore

11:27.645 --> 11:29.816
who forces learning on girls
in defiance of the Prophet.

11:29.918 --> 11:31.946
The Taliban
at least read the Quran.

11:31.947 --> 11:36.488
If you are ISIS, you know
your founder couldn't even
read his own name.

11:36.590 --> 11:38.224
[chuckles]

11:38.326 --> 11:42.297
So, I am speaking
to an educated woman?
Yes, you are.

11:42.298 --> 11:46.166
Well, I don't need to explain
that there is a price
to be paid for arrogance.

11:46.830 --> 11:48.365
[grunts]

11:48.467 --> 11:51.006
[crying]
You fled here
with your cowardly parents.

11:51.671 --> 11:52.706
Look at you.

11:52.808 --> 11:54.741
You could have
made good wives

11:54.844 --> 11:57.210
if her mother
hadn't poisoned you.

11:58.646 --> 12:00.083
[girls screaming]

12:00.185 --> 12:02.381
No! No! No!

12:02.483 --> 12:03.382
Stop!

12:03.484 --> 12:05.317
No! No!

12:05.982 --> 12:07.924
[screaming]

12:12.725 --> 12:14.931
Stop! No!

12:16.133 --> 12:19.099
[leader on TV] <i>Those girls
who may be redeemed will be.</i>

12:19.201 --> 12:21.331
<i>For the daughters
of the American diplomats</i>

12:21.466 --> 12:23.373
<i>and for those
who are beyond redemption,</i>

12:23.475 --> 12:25.708
<i>ten million dollars each</i>

12:25.810 --> 12:27.704
<i>and the release
of Sheik al-Shimali,</i>

12:27.840 --> 12:31.178
<i>a holy man,
imprisoned by the corrupt
Taliban government.</i>

12:31.645 --> 12:32.751
<i>Five days.</i>

12:40.293 --> 12:42.420
[speaking in Pashto]

12:47.663 --> 12:49.094
They're gonna kill us.

12:49.196 --> 12:51.231
No, they won't.
We're worth something.

12:52.238 --> 12:54.566
Unlike my friends.

12:54.668 --> 12:57.439
Weren't you the one
who told them
they'd be safe on the roof?

12:57.541 --> 12:58.808
We all heard you.

12:58.910 --> 13:00.878
- How did that work out?
- Leave her alone.

13:00.879 --> 13:04.212
- Okay? That wasn't her fault.
- Really? Then ask her friends.

13:04.213 --> 13:07.540
Halle, you're alive right now
because your father
is the ambassador

13:07.541 --> 13:09.547
and our parents
are deputy ministers.

13:09.548 --> 13:12.154
But of course,
if you ever got your nose
out of that TikTok,

13:12.256 --> 13:15.451
you'd know that America
doesn't pay ransoms
to terrorists.

13:15.553 --> 13:17.652
So maybe wipe
that smug look off your face

13:17.754 --> 13:19.891
and realize that we're all
pretty close to dying.

13:19.892 --> 13:22.559
Or being given
to ISIS fighters.

13:23.293 --> 13:25.804
- What?
- Look around.

13:26.739 --> 13:29.331
They took maybe 50 girls
from the school.

13:29.433 --> 13:31.568
Where do you think
they are right now?

13:32.705 --> 13:33.845
Hmm?

13:41.880 --> 13:43.646
[in Pashto]

14:09.182 --> 14:10.475
[door opens]

14:20.686 --> 14:22.984
- This being 1106--
- [colonel]
Let's hold that for a second.

14:23.087 --> 14:26.027
Captain, you've been
up my ass for a year
and now you have your moment.

14:26.130 --> 14:29.033
But before
you humiliate yourself
and the service,

14:29.135 --> 14:32.035
I'm gonna give you
one last chance
to withdraw your complaint.

14:33.168 --> 14:35.305
With all respect, sir--
Fuck your respect.

14:35.306 --> 14:39.307
Warrant Officer Collins there
flew into hostile territory
and saved your life.

14:39.308 --> 14:42.408
A mission that cost the lives
of his fellow pilot
and four Rangers,

14:42.510 --> 14:45.343
wounding two others
as he was almost
shot out of the air.

14:45.445 --> 14:48.748
And yet, you want him
charged with cowardice.

14:48.850 --> 14:53.187
Perhaps the colonel would
understand if he watched
his men be executed,

14:53.289 --> 14:55.917
while Warrant Officer Collins
chose safety over duty.

14:56.019 --> 14:57.020
Safety?

14:57.122 --> 14:59.258
You're right, Captain.

14:59.360 --> 15:01.658
That must have been
a terrible decision to make.

15:02.793 --> 15:06.070
Maybe similar to one you made
just a week before that.

15:06.172 --> 15:08.697
Something some people think
you should have
been prosecuted for.

15:08.799 --> 15:11.737
- Extenuating circumstances
or not.
- Yes, sir.

15:11.839 --> 15:15.045
But you're willing
for all that to come out again
and risk prison yourself.

15:15.147 --> 15:18.007
I'm willing to
take responsibility
for my actions.

15:18.008 --> 15:19.445
He should as well.

15:21.220 --> 15:22.349
Fine.

15:23.646 --> 15:26.120
Me, I'm gonna wait
until Monday.

15:26.222 --> 15:28.619
Because I'm not in the mood
to ruin my weekend.

15:29.595 --> 15:31.028
We can go back on the record.

15:32.325 --> 15:34.124
The session
is adjourned at 1108.

15:34.226 --> 15:36.363
Get the fuck out of here.

15:42.772 --> 15:45.266
[door opens, closes]

15:45.368 --> 15:47.770
[fighters grunting]

15:51.349 --> 15:52.808
[grunts]

15:59.183 --> 16:01.223
[grunts]
[groans]

16:08.863 --> 16:10.100
[captain] Tap out.

16:10.898 --> 16:12.003
Tap out, fucker!

16:14.306 --> 16:15.435
[grunts]

16:20.479 --> 16:22.574
[both straining]

16:24.781 --> 16:26.347
You tap out, bitch.

16:45.772 --> 16:48.365
I heard you've been
making friends.

16:48.467 --> 16:50.635
Nice to see
with my own eyes, though.

16:52.304 --> 16:53.642
[sighs]
Fuck you, Travis.

16:53.643 --> 16:55.374
It should be fuck you, sir,

16:55.477 --> 16:57.708
but after that,
I don't think
I'll pick a fight.

16:58.416 --> 16:59.674
I lost.

16:59.776 --> 17:01.844
Yeah, he seems
to be savoring his victory.

17:02.752 --> 17:04.185
Hit the showers.

17:04.287 --> 17:05.881
Can't talk to someone
who smells like a horse.

17:06.658 --> 17:08.456
I know why you're here.

17:08.457 --> 17:11.194
- And you're
not gonna stop me--
- From blowing your career?

17:12.632 --> 17:13.856
Wouldn't waste my breath.

17:14.423 --> 17:16.397
Shower. Seriously.

17:32.978 --> 17:34.310
When?

17:34.311 --> 17:35.877
I leave for D.C.
in an hour.

17:35.979 --> 17:38.554
Hopefully they know more
than they did last night.

17:38.656 --> 17:42.649
I got you a seat on a C-5
departing at 1600 hours
from Wiesbaden.

17:42.650 --> 17:44.653
You fly commercial
from there.

17:44.654 --> 17:47.190
This has nothing to do
with the big brass' worry

17:47.292 --> 17:51.501
that my testimony is gonna
take the shine off the Army's
glistening reputation.

17:51.502 --> 17:53.335
It's a closed hearing.

17:53.336 --> 17:55.098
Whatever you're gonna say
is never gonna leave
that room,

17:55.200 --> 17:56.999
and you know it.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.909
The only head on a pike
outside on the gate
is gonna be yours.

18:00.011 --> 18:02.075
So you're here
to save me from myself.

18:02.177 --> 18:03.407
I won't say
I could give a fuck,

18:03.509 --> 18:05.542
as we both know
that would be a lie.

18:05.644 --> 18:07.448
But right now,
I care more about them.

18:19.258 --> 18:20.626
This is CIA bullshit.

18:21.567 --> 18:22.933
Send in Delta.

18:23.035 --> 18:25.565
We did, rescue mission
three days ago.

18:26.033 --> 18:28.065
No survivors.

18:28.167 --> 18:32.572
So this CIA bullshit is
the only hope these girls have
of seeing next week.

18:32.674 --> 18:35.043
We're going in
as an international
relief organization.

18:35.044 --> 18:37.110
Has to be 60% women
to be believable.

18:37.212 --> 18:38.982
There are a lot
of good Rangers.

18:39.084 --> 18:41.715
And you'd be surprised
how many are women.

18:41.716 --> 18:43.078
International.

18:43.180 --> 18:44.921
[laughs]

18:45.023 --> 18:47.616
Some mercenaries
from Kurd-fuckistan?

18:47.718 --> 18:49.725
I'm sure
they're the best of the best.

18:49.726 --> 18:51.590
When you meet these two,

18:51.692 --> 18:53.725
you can ask them
how many kills
they had in Ukraine.

18:54.225 --> 18:55.496
Which side?

18:56.294 --> 18:58.136
It's your choice.

18:58.238 --> 19:00.430
I just figured you'd rather
take out all that anger

19:00.533 --> 19:02.503
on the guy
who hacked up your team,

19:03.438 --> 19:05.803
instead of the pilot
who saved your life.

19:07.810 --> 19:08.942
Maybe not.

19:09.044 --> 19:10.477
I think we both know

19:10.579 --> 19:12.144
the only person you want to
see pay for that crime

19:12.246 --> 19:14.350
is sitting across from me.

19:17.581 --> 19:19.790
Canadian passport and ID.

19:19.892 --> 19:21.689
I managed to find
the one photo

19:21.791 --> 19:23.953
where you didn't have
a middle finger
in front of your face.

19:25.159 --> 19:26.824
So, you know I'm going?

19:28.126 --> 19:31.202
Seven years and I still know
almost nothing
about you, Jake.

19:32.464 --> 19:33.963
This would be the exception.

19:42.615 --> 19:43.709
Jessica Rabbit?

19:44.912 --> 19:46.279
Rabit.

19:46.280 --> 19:48.681
It's a proud,
proud French-Canadian name.

19:55.652 --> 19:57.789
[helicopter blades whirring]

20:08.673 --> 20:09.704
Miss Rabbit?

20:09.807 --> 20:11.299
Rabit, one B.

20:11.300 --> 20:12.403
Where's the car?

20:12.505 --> 20:14.406
Let me take your bag.
No. Car.

20:14.508 --> 20:16.247
It would look bad.
It is my job.

20:17.374 --> 20:19.174
Thank you.

20:19.276 --> 20:22.219
I was going to ask you
if you have any relation
to this famous--

20:22.321 --> 20:24.712
She's a fucking cartoon.
How would I be related to her?

20:24.815 --> 20:26.053
But they draw
someone, right?

20:26.155 --> 20:28.523
So maybe your mother--
Car.

20:30.287 --> 20:31.394
Car.

20:38.569 --> 20:41.195
Sorry for my car.
People drive crazy
in Pakistan.

20:45.711 --> 20:47.674
[horns beeping]

20:53.216 --> 20:55.517
- [tires screech]
- [horn blares]

20:58.690 --> 21:00.258
Holy shit!

21:00.692 --> 21:02.458
See? Crazy!

21:07.524 --> 21:08.959
[tires screech]

21:19.107 --> 21:20.971
No, no. No need.

21:21.980 --> 21:23.809
I'm celebrating being alive.

21:25.414 --> 21:27.518
You put that
toward a nice coffin.

21:27.620 --> 21:28.748
Thank you.

21:34.892 --> 21:37.220
Jessica. Raquel.

21:37.221 --> 21:38.385
Call me Rocky.

21:38.386 --> 21:39.594
It's Jake.

21:40.527 --> 21:42.999
Listen,
I don't need names.

21:43.101 --> 21:44.763
I won't remember
either of yours

21:44.865 --> 21:47.305
and they're probably
just as real
as Jessica Rabit.

21:48.303 --> 21:50.397
So you want what? Numbers?

21:50.398 --> 21:51.976
Functions.

21:52.078 --> 21:54.436
Then mechanic,
which is close enough.

21:54.538 --> 21:55.643
We're this way.

21:57.216 --> 21:59.174
This is someone's idea
of a safe house?

22:00.050 --> 22:01.815
The safest that's left.

22:01.917 --> 22:04.986
I'm afraid Pakistan
is no longer
the friendliest of allies.

22:05.088 --> 22:06.915
You American
or Afghan?

22:06.916 --> 22:09.019
Because you want to know
if you can trust me?

22:10.422 --> 22:13.364
I know at least one Afghan
I would trust
over Americans any day.

22:14.095 --> 22:15.293
Just one?

22:15.395 --> 22:17.265
One still living.

22:17.266 --> 22:20.469
We emigrated
after my father was executed.

22:20.571 --> 22:23.297
Tends to be
the Taliban's punishment
of first resort.

22:23.973 --> 22:25.606
By the CIA.

22:25.607 --> 22:28.438
He either shared information
with the Taliban under torture

22:28.439 --> 22:29.845
or he was a double agent.

22:29.947 --> 22:30.944
Which one was it?

22:30.945 --> 22:32.773
No way to know.

22:32.774 --> 22:34.780
And assumptions
are dangerous.

22:34.781 --> 22:37.651
If I made them, I could assume
you couldn't be trusted.

22:37.753 --> 22:40.116
Unless it isn't true
you killed
your own team leader.

22:42.192 --> 22:44.890
No. That is
absolutely true.

22:45.522 --> 22:46.953
Shot him?

22:46.954 --> 22:50.158
Rock. About the size
of a hardball.

22:50.260 --> 22:53.403
I played shortstop
in Baltimore.
You're a pitcher?

22:53.505 --> 22:56.000
You never know
when a skill
will come in handy.

22:57.009 --> 22:58.871
I'm sure he deserved to die.

23:00.036 --> 23:01.874
It was the last thing
he deserved.

23:03.539 --> 23:06.681
And I assume
you shared this tidbit
with the rest of the team?

23:07.712 --> 23:10.850
No. They shared it with me.

23:29.172 --> 23:30.940
When does Travis land?

23:31.042 --> 23:32.673
That's Rocky's chair.

23:32.674 --> 23:35.204
And I bet she's been here
long enough to find another.

23:37.815 --> 23:39.040
Travis?

23:39.142 --> 23:41.085
- [Rocky] In the air.
- Which is our Wi-Fi?

23:41.187 --> 23:43.214
The one
named Secret Secure Network.

23:43.316 --> 23:44.749
[chuckles]

23:44.851 --> 23:46.616
We have a long time
to prep, do we?

23:46.718 --> 23:49.352
You read Arabic? Daylight743?

23:49.353 --> 23:50.720
You set this up.

23:50.822 --> 23:52.257
So you're Tech, right?
Mm-hmm.

23:52.359 --> 23:54.330
Cher, no relation.

23:54.432 --> 23:56.731
She doesn't need names.
Just functions.

23:57.498 --> 23:58.867
Well, aren't you
a charmer?

23:58.868 --> 24:00.462
Call me Geek.

24:00.565 --> 24:01.564
That's Rachel.

24:01.666 --> 24:03.136
Weapons specialist.

24:03.238 --> 24:04.237
[both] Shooter!

24:04.339 --> 24:05.809
[imitating gunfire]

24:05.911 --> 24:06.967
"Shooter" it is.

24:07.069 --> 24:08.608
You already
pissed off Theresa.

24:08.710 --> 24:11.446
Explosives,
which may not have been wise.

24:11.548 --> 24:13.877
- You can call me "The Bomb."
- I like that.

24:13.878 --> 24:15.714
[The Bomb] Always wanted someone
to call me that.

24:15.715 --> 24:17.382
[Geek] You are The Bomb.
[The Bomb chuckles]

24:17.383 --> 24:19.456
Oh, and here's our medic.

24:19.558 --> 24:21.720
Hi. Was just in conference
with our real doctor.

24:21.721 --> 24:24.554
- Conference, right.
- Somebody's jealous.

24:24.555 --> 24:26.724
Girl, bah.
Not at all.

24:26.725 --> 24:28.731
I'm sure the close bond
you've established

24:28.732 --> 24:32.499
over the last, what,
seven hours has been
professional and productive.

24:32.601 --> 24:34.664
- Jane.
- She only wants functions.

24:34.766 --> 24:36.098
I thought
we'd be friends.

24:36.200 --> 24:38.102
- As you make them so easily.
- [Medic laughs]

24:38.969 --> 24:40.142
[Geek]
Oh, and here's Dr. Mike.

24:40.244 --> 24:41.807
We just call him Dr. Mike

24:41.910 --> 24:44.077
because he's the only one
going by his real name.

24:44.078 --> 24:45.812
Mike.
Jake.

24:45.914 --> 24:47.909
[Geek] Nah, nah, nah, nah.
We gonna call you Rabbit.

24:47.910 --> 24:50.682
Because what rabbits
do best is run.

24:50.784 --> 24:52.785
You see, Rabbit here
escaped a hellhole

24:52.887 --> 24:55.523
and left her whole team behind
to be slaughtered.

24:55.625 --> 24:57.959
That was after
she killed her own CO.

24:58.062 --> 24:59.420
Right, Rabbit?

25:02.268 --> 25:03.991
Look, don't take offense,
Rabbit.

25:04.093 --> 25:06.129
Dr. Mike
doesn't like us either.

25:06.231 --> 25:08.496
We're just using him
to get us across the border.

25:08.598 --> 25:11.271
Been waiting a month
for permission
from the Pakistanis

25:11.272 --> 25:12.604
to take medicine to Khost.

25:12.605 --> 25:15.672
I agree.
It magically appeared.

25:15.774 --> 25:17.171
Khost, just across the border?

25:17.273 --> 25:19.315
As far as the Taliban
will allow us to go.

25:19.417 --> 25:21.651
Also, where they're
holding the sheik.

25:21.753 --> 25:23.882
Not that we had a chance
of getting him
out of that prison.

25:23.984 --> 25:26.150
- That was the plan?
- Not one of our best.

25:27.652 --> 25:29.183
All Americans.

25:29.285 --> 25:31.790
So who is this?
[Shooter] Badia Durani.

25:31.791 --> 25:35.032
Mother was the Afghan
Minister of Education.

25:35.134 --> 25:36.831
Meeting her this morning.

25:37.332 --> 25:38.860
We're meeting her?

25:38.962 --> 25:40.703
That's on Travis.
Great.

25:41.437 --> 25:42.705
Even mom knows we're here.

25:43.837 --> 25:47.503
So, we cross the border.
Then what?

25:47.606 --> 25:50.845
Drop off the medicine,
then discover we have
a cracked distributor cap.

25:50.947 --> 25:53.179
Getting a new one
will give us two days.
Maybe three.

25:53.281 --> 25:56.684
Can't take any weapons.
Have to assume they're gonna
strip the truck.

25:56.786 --> 25:59.320
Travis's fucking weapon stash
better be there.

25:59.321 --> 26:01.520
Right.
All our ID will hold up?

26:01.622 --> 26:03.484
Names are all real staff.

26:04.162 --> 26:06.187
Six women, two men.

26:06.289 --> 26:08.196
You can count me
on their side of the column.

26:08.197 --> 26:10.064
Not wearing a fucking burqa.

26:10.166 --> 26:11.400
[chuckles]

26:11.502 --> 26:13.362
Where's the nearest
Internet café?

26:28.711 --> 26:30.016
Salaam.

26:30.584 --> 26:33.954
[speaking in Pashto]

26:51.340 --> 26:54.275
[ringing tone]

26:54.377 --> 26:55.745
[receiver, in Pashto]

26:57.510 --> 26:59.474
[in Pashto]

27:00.579 --> 27:01.878
Who is this?

27:01.981 --> 27:03.819
[Jake] <i>English.
So you're alone.</i>

27:05.886 --> 27:07.383
Tell me you're calling
from America.

27:08.424 --> 27:10.887
Awina, I need your help.

27:10.888 --> 27:13.095
I'm Taliban
and loyal to my country.

27:13.197 --> 27:16.558
And the only people who
hate ISIS more than
the Americans is your Taliban.

27:16.559 --> 27:17.833
[sighs]

27:18.801 --> 27:21.436
<i>I need to know
where the American girls are.</i>

27:21.437 --> 27:23.436
Are you insane?
How would I know?

27:23.538 --> 27:25.603
[call waiting beeps]

27:25.705 --> 27:27.001
You know how you know.

27:27.103 --> 27:28.839
Well, I don't.
No one knows.

27:28.941 --> 27:30.577
You have 12 hours
to find out.

27:30.578 --> 27:32.610
Don't come here.
I won't meet you.

27:32.712 --> 27:34.117
<i>You know that's a lie.</i>

27:34.252 --> 27:35.515
<i>And you know where.</i>

27:35.617 --> 27:38.484
[call waiting beeps]
What?

27:38.619 --> 27:41.319
[Travis] <i>How the fuck
did you get here before me
and you're still late?</i>

27:41.421 --> 27:42.256
Where?

27:42.257 --> 27:44.453
[overlapping chatter]

27:53.630 --> 27:55.603
Anything more complicated,
you go straight to medic.

27:55.604 --> 27:56.998
Anything life-threatening--
Got it, Doc.

27:57.100 --> 27:58.335
Can you give us a second?

28:00.310 --> 28:01.976
Sure.
Thank you.

28:04.073 --> 28:05.540
Got you a green tea.

28:07.816 --> 28:09.786
I hear you've been
making more friends.

28:11.155 --> 28:12.283
Friends die.

28:13.450 --> 28:15.726
Which is a pretty sure bet
after what I've seen.

28:17.655 --> 28:18.828
So,

28:20.030 --> 28:24.501
we go in, find them based on
questionable satellite data,

28:24.603 --> 28:27.834
and if we find them,
we shoot our way out.

28:27.936 --> 28:29.971
Well, it's a little more
refined than that.

28:29.972 --> 28:31.131
Yeah.

28:31.132 --> 28:32.874
I hear you have
a weapon stash.

28:32.976 --> 28:34.973
Something
for a rainy day.
You sure it's still there?

28:34.974 --> 28:37.370
They proved pretty good
at finding shit we left.

28:37.472 --> 28:39.906
Under a metal floor
I welded shut.

28:40.008 --> 28:41.510
She's early.

28:44.780 --> 28:47.550
How many people
are you telling
about your secret plan?

28:47.652 --> 28:48.651
Nobody.

28:48.652 --> 28:49.883
She found us.

28:49.985 --> 28:51.762
Beautiful.

28:54.495 --> 28:55.823
Minister.

28:55.824 --> 28:57.525
Former. Camila.

28:57.627 --> 28:59.735
You'll forgive us if we
don't introduce ourselves.

28:59.837 --> 29:01.532
I know why you're here.
That's all I need.

29:01.634 --> 29:02.935
Please, sit.

29:03.037 --> 29:04.538
I'm curious
to how you actually do know.

29:04.640 --> 29:06.168
And I wish
I could tell you.

29:06.169 --> 29:08.403
[Travis] Coffee?
This won't take long.

29:08.505 --> 29:11.039
Do you know where
my daughter is being held?

29:11.141 --> 29:13.241
We have good information.

29:13.343 --> 29:15.015
Even better
than the last time?

29:15.016 --> 29:19.250
Minister, we're risking lives
based on that information.

29:19.352 --> 29:22.355
So we're gonna do our darndest
to make sure it's right.

29:22.356 --> 29:24.091
I appreciate it.

29:24.193 --> 29:26.796
But if it turns out
your darndest
isn't good enough,

29:26.898 --> 29:29.123
I would ask you to deliver
the ransom they demand.

29:29.225 --> 29:30.957
That's 70 million dollars.

29:31.059 --> 29:32.060
Ten million.

29:32.162 --> 29:33.430
So for just your daughter?

29:34.704 --> 29:36.198
I hope to have it
by tomorrow.

29:36.199 --> 29:37.706
You know we can't do that,
Minister.

29:37.707 --> 29:39.708
I'm giving you the option,
if you need it.

29:39.709 --> 29:42.139
To save my daughter from
being publicly beheaded.

29:42.241 --> 29:45.547
- But just your daughter?
- Mine will be first.

29:45.548 --> 29:47.379
Make a show
of the Afghan girl,

29:47.380 --> 29:50.112
so the Americans
use some back channel
to pay for their own.

29:50.214 --> 29:51.745
As they have done
many times.

29:53.259 --> 29:55.118
For you to consider.

29:55.220 --> 29:57.155
I came to help you
cross the border

29:57.257 --> 29:59.491
where you may be
most at risk of discovery.

29:59.593 --> 30:01.294
Arguable.

30:01.396 --> 30:04.392
An old friend named Bashir
is a supervisor
at the crossing.

30:04.393 --> 30:06.294
- He'll help you through.
- How do we find him?

30:06.396 --> 30:09.130
Don't ask.
It will draw attention.

30:09.232 --> 30:10.771
He'll be watching for you.

30:10.873 --> 30:13.066
May Allah
watch over you as well.

30:13.067 --> 30:14.339
[Travis] Thank you.

30:15.711 --> 30:17.309
Bring me back my daughter.

30:18.978 --> 30:21.115
We'll do everything we can.

30:32.826 --> 30:34.428
Miss Rabbit, hello.

30:34.429 --> 30:35.663
Very good to see you.

30:35.766 --> 30:37.126
You have
to be fucking kidding.

30:37.228 --> 30:38.432
Come, come with me,
Miss Rabbit.

30:38.433 --> 30:40.497
Abbas. Not a chance.

30:41.768 --> 30:43.438
Enjoy the ride.

30:43.439 --> 30:44.771
And thanks for the name.

30:44.772 --> 30:46.943
Gotta find pleasure
in my work.

30:55.011 --> 30:56.150
Excuse me.

30:57.454 --> 30:59.553
Miss Rabbit, come.

30:59.655 --> 31:01.354
Let me help you.
Rabit.

31:01.456 --> 31:02.552
One B.

31:04.761 --> 31:07.624
Yes, I know.
Like the Bugs Bunny.

31:07.625 --> 31:09.121
Me, Malik.

31:09.122 --> 31:10.627
Drive, Malik.

31:10.628 --> 31:11.825
Mal-eek.

31:13.195 --> 31:14.465
[engine starts]

31:38.055 --> 31:40.194
[horns blaring]

31:50.465 --> 31:52.569
[officials speaking in Pashto]

31:57.008 --> 31:58.443
Oh, Miss Rabbit.

31:59.174 --> 32:00.610
[in Pashto]

32:09.423 --> 32:11.683
Do you have any idea
what time
our connection works?

32:11.684 --> 32:14.290
'Cause this looks like hours.
Wish I knew.

32:14.392 --> 32:15.924
Looks like
we're waiting it out.

32:16.027 --> 32:17.124
[Abbas] Boss.

32:17.226 --> 32:18.432
I fix. No worries.

32:18.535 --> 32:20.729
Abbas. Abbas!

32:32.448 --> 32:33.946
Thanks.

32:34.048 --> 32:36.151
No worries.
Abbas will fix.

32:36.851 --> 32:38.956
Bad driver, good fixer.

32:39.458 --> 32:40.650
Happy to hear that.

32:41.759 --> 32:44.218
You like music?
I like music.

32:44.219 --> 32:46.726
Taliban and ISIS hate music.

32:46.727 --> 32:47.998
Only reason I hate them.

32:48.897 --> 32:50.462
Just their problem with music?

32:51.932 --> 32:53.234
You like The Doors?

32:53.867 --> 32:54.930
I like The Doors.

32:55.032 --> 32:56.138
Steppenwolf?

32:57.734 --> 33:00.175
You have a surprising
musical vocabulary, Malik.

33:00.775 --> 33:02.842
Ma-leek.
Ma-leek.

33:02.944 --> 33:04.514
I've learned
from my brother.

33:04.616 --> 33:05.840
He plays in a cover band.

33:07.447 --> 33:09.579
Your brother, Abbas,
plays in a cover band?

33:09.580 --> 33:12.847
His favorite song,
Steppenwolf,
"Born To Be Wild."

33:13.722 --> 33:14.783
It's a great song.

33:15.759 --> 33:17.951
Bad driver,
great singer.

33:20.598 --> 33:21.823
You love your brother.

33:23.435 --> 33:24.826
Abbas saved me.

33:25.436 --> 33:26.531
Many times.

33:27.099 --> 33:28.467
I owe him everything.

33:30.575 --> 33:32.042
You know that feeling.

33:32.970 --> 33:34.110
I do.

33:35.579 --> 33:36.676
[Abbas whistles]

33:36.778 --> 33:37.839
What did I say?

33:39.816 --> 33:42.349
Good fixer.
And singer.

33:42.916 --> 33:44.319
Very good singer.

33:44.320 --> 33:45.616
Bad driver.

33:46.655 --> 33:48.025
[horn honks]

33:54.093 --> 33:55.829
[shouting in Pashto]

33:55.931 --> 33:57.790
[captain] Get back inside!

33:57.791 --> 34:00.301
[Abbas] Salaam alaikum.
Salaam alaikum.

34:01.497 --> 34:02.905
[shouting in Pashto]
Go back!

34:03.007 --> 34:04.866
What are you doing here?
Go back in line.

34:06.170 --> 34:07.572
[door closes]

34:09.979 --> 34:11.139
[captain]
You're not listening!

34:11.140 --> 34:12.977
Okay, open the truck.

34:12.978 --> 34:15.045
Everything out! Open it.

34:15.147 --> 34:17.387
[shouting in Pashto]

34:17.489 --> 34:19.155
[glass shattering]

34:22.894 --> 34:24.817
Medical supplies!
You break them!

34:24.818 --> 34:27.663
Medical supplies!
You're breaking them.

34:27.664 --> 34:29.529
You wanna kill
your own people.

34:29.631 --> 34:31.866
[guard] Shut the fuck--
[Abbas]
They are to save your people.

34:31.968 --> 34:33.265
Your own people!
You kill them!

34:33.367 --> 34:35.332
Those are medicines,
for Christ's sake.

34:35.333 --> 34:37.538
Doc, don't engage.
Get back in the car.

34:37.640 --> 34:39.568
I'm not the one--
How long since you've been
back here? Twenty years?

34:39.670 --> 34:41.074
You think the Taliban
don't respect women

34:41.176 --> 34:43.703
but are tolerant
of cross-dressers?

34:43.805 --> 34:45.577
I'm not a--
Get in the fucking car!

34:47.645 --> 34:51.379
Stop! Just stop!
Read. "Antibiotics."

34:51.481 --> 34:53.053
Drugs, you poison our people!

34:53.155 --> 34:55.058
Antibiotics,
you fucking muggle!

34:55.160 --> 34:57.394
- Muggle?
- What you call me?
What you call me?

34:57.496 --> 34:59.795
I called you a fucking muggle.
You're breaking
the very thing that you--

34:59.898 --> 35:01.422
Muggle is
a very serious man.

35:01.524 --> 35:02.765
Don't even believe in wizards.

35:02.867 --> 35:04.062
Look at
the fucking label!

35:04.164 --> 35:05.691
Would you
shut the fuck up?

35:05.692 --> 35:07.399
Are you trying
to never get laid?

35:07.501 --> 35:09.195
There are weapons.
I know there are weapons.

35:09.196 --> 35:10.907
No weapons.

35:11.009 --> 35:13.436
Thinking we tell 'em
we're here to kill ISIS?

35:13.538 --> 35:15.073
At least we'll be
on the same side.

35:15.175 --> 35:16.641
Maybe keep that to yourself.

35:17.075 --> 35:19.215
[in Pashto]

35:38.967 --> 35:41.904
[shouting in Pashto]

35:41.905 --> 35:44.307
Apologies.
You may continue on your way.

35:44.409 --> 35:45.642
Bashir?

35:45.744 --> 35:47.306
We appreciate the kindness.

35:47.408 --> 35:49.436
In an emergency only,
call this number.

35:49.538 --> 35:50.910
Can't promise to help.

35:50.911 --> 35:52.505
Hopefully we won't need it.

35:52.607 --> 35:53.944
May Allah be with you.

35:54.047 --> 35:55.152
And with you.

36:04.553 --> 36:05.992
You reach for an insult,

36:06.094 --> 36:07.758
and you pull out Harry Potter.

36:08.423 --> 36:09.628
Magnificent.

36:53.170 --> 36:54.578
Jail.

36:54.680 --> 36:56.836
Yeah. Looks like it.

36:56.938 --> 36:59.509
Cleric.
Sheik al-Shimali. Jail.

36:59.611 --> 37:01.012
So that's where
they're keeping him.

37:01.114 --> 37:02.483
Do not pass go.

37:03.282 --> 37:04.881
Now Monopoly, Malik.

37:05.680 --> 37:07.313
Abbas always beats me.

37:07.314 --> 37:08.716
He cheats.

37:08.818 --> 37:11.723
I cheat too,
but he cheats better.

37:13.394 --> 37:15.727
So many reasons
to look up to him.

37:20.704 --> 37:22.063
[door opens]

37:25.973 --> 37:27.871
[in Pashto]

37:37.679 --> 37:38.849
[speaking in Pashto]

37:41.324 --> 37:43.359
[door closes]
I'll do anything you want.

37:44.058 --> 37:45.119
Then have coffee.

37:45.696 --> 37:47.264
What?
Sit.

37:50.592 --> 37:54.197
We have had no response
from our offer to release you
and your friends.

37:54.198 --> 37:57.932
Other than the American
is trying to kill us,
of course. [chuckles]

37:58.035 --> 38:00.240
But, you know, that
didn't work well for them.

38:00.342 --> 38:01.901
No, that wasn't my fault.
No, no, no.

38:02.003 --> 38:04.281
None of this
is your fault, I know.

38:05.275 --> 38:06.580
Sip.

38:08.881 --> 38:11.486
I have decided that we need
to show good faith.

38:13.089 --> 38:14.647
So I'm let you go.
You what?

38:14.749 --> 38:16.957
I'm letting you go free.

38:17.059 --> 38:19.123
Me?
You're surprised.

38:19.225 --> 38:21.087
I understand that.

38:21.189 --> 38:23.262
Based on what your media
is trying to paint us.

38:23.365 --> 38:25.329
You threw my friends
off the roof.

38:25.431 --> 38:27.964
Yes, it was a monstrous act.

38:29.205 --> 38:31.767
But, you know,
we have our cause

38:31.869 --> 38:33.734
and we believe strongly
in that cause.

38:33.735 --> 38:35.241
The American
believe in theirs.

38:35.242 --> 38:37.842
And they killed
so many of us.

38:37.944 --> 38:42.077
Our families, our childrens,
with their drones and bombs.

38:42.811 --> 38:44.651
Since before you were born.

38:46.318 --> 38:47.918
My family as well.

38:50.223 --> 38:51.625
I had two girls.

38:53.489 --> 38:54.991
And a wife.

38:56.158 --> 38:58.764
You know, I'm not going to try
to convince you.

39:00.601 --> 39:03.133
- Should I pick someone else?
- No, no.

39:03.235 --> 39:04.803
No. I'll go.

39:06.072 --> 39:07.168
Good.

39:12.017 --> 39:13.680
I want you
to deliver this note

39:14.413 --> 39:15.676
to the police station.

39:15.778 --> 39:17.618
The Taliban police?
Yes.

39:18.117 --> 39:19.356
Tell me.

39:20.750 --> 39:22.557
Can I trust you to do that?

39:24.992 --> 39:26.661
Yes.

39:26.763 --> 39:27.859
You can.

39:28.524 --> 39:29.663
Thank you.

39:30.495 --> 39:31.700
Finish your coffee.

39:31.802 --> 39:33.199
That's okay.

39:33.301 --> 39:35.570
I know.
It's bitter as hell.

39:36.169 --> 39:37.737

[starter grinding]

40:40.202 --> 40:42.967
[arguing in Pashto]

40:53.676 --> 40:56.318
They want us all to leave
in the other truck
as soon as we are unloaded.

40:56.420 --> 40:59.412
- It's not good.
- No. Abbas will fix.

41:00.120 --> 41:01.249
Okay.

41:01.950 --> 41:03.252
That's what okay looks like?

41:03.354 --> 41:04.753
Yes.

41:04.855 --> 41:06.226
I paid them,
the rest is show.

41:06.227 --> 41:08.931
- That's some show.
- Yeah.

41:09.033 --> 41:10.126
You see behind, boss?

41:12.134 --> 41:13.231
See the humby?

41:13.232 --> 41:14.632
I see the Humvee.

41:14.734 --> 41:16.671
Yes, humby.
Look where it drives.

41:17.900 --> 41:19.404
Where they keep the big guns.

41:19.405 --> 41:21.176
The armory.
[Abbas] No, no.

41:21.278 --> 41:23.608
Guns, bombs,
shit goes boom.

41:23.710 --> 41:26.113
Thanks, Abbas.
We got it covered.

41:26.215 --> 41:27.847
No problem, always.

41:28.313 --> 41:29.618
Malik.

41:32.618 --> 41:34.920
Shit goes boom.
[chuckles]

Rachel, Theresa, headscarves.

41:55.574 --> 41:57.140
Let's go grab some toys.

41:59.115 --> 42:00.111
It's The Bomb.

42:00.112 --> 42:01.178
What is?

42:01.280 --> 42:02.509
I am.

42:02.611 --> 42:03.850

42:58.504 --> 43:00.601
Aim a gun.
Pull the trigger.

43:00.703 --> 43:02.073
Next time.

43:03.148 --> 43:05.043
Fuck you
for coming back.

43:06.174 --> 43:07.914
Fuck you
for still being here.

43:11.353 --> 43:12.780
I fight for my home.

43:12.882 --> 43:14.415
Just not very well.

43:18.557 --> 43:19.959
Where are they?

43:35.279 --> 43:37.471
[dogs barking in distance]

43:46.385 --> 43:47.481
Fuck.

43:48.887 --> 43:50.320
[The Bomb]
So it's under there?

43:50.422 --> 43:51.923
Fuck!

43:52.025 --> 43:53.795
Thought a satellite's
been keeping an eye on it.

43:58.025 --> 44:00.631
[The Bomb] Guess a flat roof
looks like a flat roof
from outer space.

44:00.733 --> 44:02.834
- [Shooter] Orbit.
- What?

44:02.936 --> 44:05.136
Satellites are in orbit,
not outer space.

44:06.100 --> 44:07.435
Then that explains it.

44:10.772 --> 44:11.912
Fuck!

44:26.329 --> 44:27.490
Got me some wheels.

44:27.592 --> 44:28.854
Steal it?

44:28.956 --> 44:30.295
Borrowed it.

44:30.397 --> 44:31.629
Borrowed it?

44:31.731 --> 44:33.527
Should've stolen
a bulldozer.

44:38.169 --> 44:41.436
Got you this.
Black market. Fifty bucks.

44:44.982 --> 44:46.111
Beauty.

45:10.304 --> 45:11.235
Go!

45:28.284 --> 45:29.990
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

45:31.054 --> 45:32.828
I was told to give you this.

45:41.004 --> 45:45.874
"This you get for betraying
your faith and your cause."

45:59.886 --> 46:02.385
[explosion]
[car alarms blaring]

46:02.920 --> 46:04.057
What the fuck is that?

46:05.222 --> 46:07.061
[The Bomb]
About five keys of C-4.

46:07.163 --> 46:09.029
ISIS.

46:09.030 --> 46:12.023
No one in the world
seems to notice
there's a civil war here.

46:12.024 --> 46:13.693
Malik. Malik.

46:15.439 --> 46:16.729
Malik will check, boss.

46:20.006 --> 46:23.736
Miss Rabbit, you okay?
I go check.

46:24.874 --> 46:26.145
[door opens]

46:28.516 --> 46:29.819
[door closes]

46:32.949 --> 46:34.321
Doc, you mind?

46:34.423 --> 46:35.616
It's what I do.

46:38.025 --> 46:40.056
All right.
Easy stuff first.
[door closes]

46:40.057 --> 46:41.929
Satellite data
places the hostages here.

46:42.031 --> 46:44.297
And we're still loving
the satellite confirmation?

46:44.399 --> 46:46.893
[Travis] Farmhouse.
Twenty klicks south.
Confirmed by two sources.

46:46.894 --> 46:47.903
They're wrong.

46:49.102 --> 46:51.274
They're at
an abandoned tobacco factory.

46:51.376 --> 46:52.974
Those are the coordinates.

46:53.608 --> 46:54.904
And you know this how?

46:54.905 --> 46:56.942
[panting]
Source is a midwife.

46:57.044 --> 46:59.813
A small circle here,
and midwives talk.

46:59.915 --> 47:02.240
One of Amir's women
gave birth two days ago.

47:02.241 --> 47:03.820
And your source was there?

47:04.419 --> 47:05.820
She wasn't.

47:05.922 --> 47:08.149
But her friend told her
the American girls were.

47:08.251 --> 47:10.123
Just out in the yard
doing yoga?

47:11.954 --> 47:13.156
In a cage.

47:13.258 --> 47:15.192
One of them
had a bad cut on her arm.

47:15.295 --> 47:17.960
And the midwife was asked
to clean the wound.

47:18.062 --> 47:19.330
And we trust this source?

47:21.833 --> 47:23.103
She's Taliban.

47:23.835 --> 47:25.439
I saved her life.

47:25.440 --> 47:27.701
ISIS was closing in on us.

47:28.576 --> 47:30.375
I got her out.

47:30.477 --> 47:32.441
She would have been
beheaded on the spot
for cooperating with us.

47:32.442 --> 47:34.877
Unlike the rest of your unit
that was hacked to pieces.

47:34.979 --> 47:36.044
[Travis] That's enough.

47:36.146 --> 47:38.610
We stow this shit right now,

47:38.611 --> 47:41.649
we start acting like a team,
or we fucking die.

47:43.153 --> 47:44.960
You believe her?
[Jake] I do.

47:45.923 --> 47:47.028
Yours is a trap.

47:47.863 --> 47:49.331
And she's willing
to come with us.

47:49.433 --> 47:51.395
That says it all to me.

47:52.433 --> 47:53.826
Okay.

47:54.799 --> 47:56.534
So weapons.

47:56.636 --> 47:57.731
The stash?

47:58.309 --> 47:59.406
Sensitive subject.

47:59.508 --> 48:00.833
[siren wailing]

48:03.307 --> 48:05.644
Abbas,
we're taking your armory.

48:05.645 --> 48:08.081
Smart, boss. Let's do it.

48:08.183 --> 48:10.509
- Seriously?
- [Travis] We use
what's been given to us.

48:10.611 --> 48:13.083
Rocky,
we can't use the NGO car.

48:13.185 --> 48:14.924
I need you to steal me
another one.

48:18.726 --> 48:20.896
[door opens, closes]

48:20.998 --> 48:24.191
So, we're taking the base
with some Molotov cocktails

48:24.293 --> 48:26.496
and a rifle from World War I.

Abbas, Humvee.
Everybody else
grab what we need.

[grunts]

52:01.715 --> 52:02.877
Yes!

52:16.897 --> 52:18.325
Stop, go back!

52:18.427 --> 52:20.229
Sorry, Miss.
Go back!

52:20.230 --> 52:22.436
We're not leaving him!
Go back!

52:22.538 --> 52:24.270
Can't.

52:24.372 --> 52:26.303
You know what
they're gonna do
with the body.

52:26.405 --> 52:28.177
If that was Abbas,
would you leave him?

52:29.942 --> 52:31.070
Would you?

53:02.405 --> 53:04.477

53:41.443 --> 53:42.713
Bring them home.

53:44.317 --> 53:45.881
Fuck you.
You're gonna be fine.

53:54.765 --> 53:56.892

[engine running]

54:53.888 --> 54:55.456

55:02.199 --> 55:04.560
I'm calling that number
in two minutes.

55:04.561 --> 55:06.467
I need you to trace
the location.

55:08.297 --> 55:09.470
[grunts]

55:10.236 --> 55:11.769
What the fuck was that?

55:13.570 --> 55:15.975
We don't leave men behind.

55:16.077 --> 55:17.772
No, you get them killed.

55:17.874 --> 55:20.114
You wanna make up
for abandoning your men?

55:20.216 --> 55:21.977
Do it at
someone else's expense.

55:25.452 --> 55:27.586
Right now,
they don't know who we are.

55:27.587 --> 55:31.156
But if they find an American
with Doc's ID, they will.

55:31.258 --> 55:33.424
And we'll have no way out.

55:33.425 --> 55:35.963
Hey, I'm connected,
and we're online.

55:36.065 --> 55:37.696
That's why
you went back?

55:39.163 --> 55:40.600
No.

55:45.369 --> 55:46.875
[Bashir] <i>Hello?</i>

55:46.977 --> 55:48.504
We need what you offered.

55:48.640 --> 55:50.210
[Bashir]
<i>Half the city's on fire.</i>

55:50.346 --> 55:52.072
<i>The police
are searching for you.</i>

55:52.174 --> 55:54.306
[Jake] For us?
<i>I don't know.
Some say it was ISIS.</i>

55:55.609 --> 55:57.084
It wasn't.

55:57.187 --> 55:58.648
[Bashir]
<i>That doesn't matter now.</i>

55:58.783 --> 55:59.921
<i>They'll find you.
I can't help you.</i>

56:00.023 --> 56:02.185
Bashir, wait. Just listen.

56:02.287 --> 56:03.491
<i>Listen to what?</i>

56:05.227 --> 56:06.685
We'll see you soon.
<i>See me?</i>

56:06.787 --> 56:08.559
We're close. Five miles.

56:08.661 --> 56:12.060
Driving in that?
We won't make it a mile.

56:18.006 --> 56:20.706
Geek. Let's go.

56:39.820 --> 56:41.430
[engine approaching]

56:49.162 --> 56:51.333
You cannot stay here.
You have to go.

56:51.334 --> 56:53.002
But we have no choice.

56:53.870 --> 56:55.576
We need somewhere
to bury our dead.

56:57.879 --> 56:59.241
[sighs]

58:03.814 --> 58:04.942
Miss Rabbit.

58:07.312 --> 58:08.440
Miss Rabbit.

58:11.217 --> 58:12.345
Miss Rabbit!

58:14.617 --> 58:15.755
It's deep enough.

58:44.183 --> 58:45.717
[sighs]

58:45.819 --> 58:47.688
- [door closes]
- [Camila]
This won't take long.

58:49.290 --> 58:51.450
[chattering, indistinct]

59:03.866 --> 59:06.300
- You called her?
- Of course.

59:07.806 --> 59:09.501
How did you get in
the country?

59:10.710 --> 59:12.707
He tells me
two of your men are dead.

59:12.809 --> 59:15.013
I'm very sorry to hear it.

59:15.014 --> 59:18.915
The news says
it was an ISIS attack.
Same as the police station.

59:19.018 --> 59:22.521
One of the girls from
the school was found there.

59:22.623 --> 59:25.484
At least her uniform
and parts of her.

59:26.556 --> 59:27.695
Caucasian.

59:29.026 --> 59:31.357
I was wrong about
who would be first to die.

59:31.459 --> 59:34.229
But I don't think
I will be wrong
about the second.

59:37.732 --> 59:39.036
Ten million.

59:40.001 --> 59:41.706
You heard what Travis said.

59:41.808 --> 59:43.909
Travis is dead,
so who's in charge?

59:48.382 --> 59:50.247
Then it's your decision.

59:50.350 --> 59:51.851
All thousands?

59:53.651 --> 59:55.019
Thousand-dollar bills?

59:56.088 --> 59:58.383
I didn't know there were
that many in circulation.

59:58.485 --> 01:00:00.092
Where'd you find
ten million in thousands?

01:00:00.194 --> 01:00:01.553
She didn't.

01:00:03.199 --> 01:00:04.632
They're counterfeit.

01:00:04.734 --> 01:00:07.259
You want us to pay a ransom
in counterfeit bills?

01:00:07.361 --> 01:00:09.797
It's all I could get.
They shouldn't notice.

01:00:09.899 --> 01:00:11.230
Took her less than a minute.

01:00:11.332 --> 01:00:13.736
Amir is not American.
It will give you time.

01:00:13.839 --> 01:00:15.971
This just gets better
and better.

01:00:16.073 --> 01:00:19.480
Your rescue failed.
What choice do you have?

01:00:19.582 --> 01:00:22.874
Save one girl.
America will pay for the rest.

01:00:22.875 --> 01:00:25.145
Then you can escape.

01:00:25.247 --> 01:00:27.546
I assume that's why
you're here, to escape?

01:00:32.252 --> 01:00:34.388
Do one good thing
before you go.

01:00:42.470 --> 01:00:43.900
Do we even have a way out?

01:00:43.901 --> 01:00:46.100
I have a number
to call for evacuation.

01:00:46.202 --> 01:00:47.766
Black Hawk sitting hot
across the border.

01:00:47.868 --> 01:00:49.403
So call it.

01:00:53.416 --> 01:00:55.816
All cell phones
on the table.

01:00:55.918 --> 01:00:58.647
If the news is fake,
they could be trying
to track us.

01:00:58.749 --> 01:01:00.612
I'm keeping mine off.

01:01:01.789 --> 01:01:03.758
Pull the SIMs.
Smash everything good.

01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:07.454
Fuck you!
No!

01:01:17.139 --> 01:01:18.267
[door opens]

01:01:19.332 --> 01:01:20.775
You admire women?
[door closes]

01:01:21.643 --> 01:01:23.470
That why you threw them
off the roof?

01:01:25.676 --> 01:01:26.841
Where is Halle?

01:01:26.943 --> 01:01:28.508
I promised
to let her go.

01:01:29.085 --> 01:01:30.279
And I did.

01:01:30.646 --> 01:01:31.951
Right.

01:01:33.113 --> 01:01:34.646
I hear we are moving.

01:01:35.490 --> 01:01:37.015
Americans coming, are they?

01:01:37.117 --> 01:01:38.689
The guards like to talk.

01:01:38.791 --> 01:01:40.726
If I was afraid
of the American,

01:01:40.828 --> 01:01:42.995
I wouldn't make plans
to marry you.

01:01:44.861 --> 01:01:46.500
[chuckling] Marry me?

01:01:46.602 --> 01:01:48.803
We just need to wait
for the cleric.

01:01:51.298 --> 01:01:52.869
You are out of
your fucking mind.

01:01:52.971 --> 01:01:56.708
I decided
I need a strong woman

01:01:56.810 --> 01:01:58.743
to give me childrens
who are fighters.

01:01:58.845 --> 01:02:02.476
Because weak women
make weak childrens.

01:02:03.278 --> 01:02:06.486
I would rather die
than marry you.

01:02:06.487 --> 01:02:08.988
That's going to be
exact your choice.

01:02:10.117 --> 01:02:13.190
But, by marrying me,

01:02:14.290 --> 01:02:16.556
you will save
the lives of your friends.

01:02:19.534 --> 01:02:21.097
You'll let them go?
No.

01:02:21.199 --> 01:02:24.201
I will marry them
to my most loyal fighters.

01:02:25.341 --> 01:02:26.441
They deserve the reward.

01:02:26.543 --> 01:02:28.333
Better than being sold
to slavery,

01:02:28.334 --> 01:02:30.702
where they will be
treated differently.

01:02:32.209 --> 01:02:35.047
I won't marry you
without your consent.

01:02:49.056 --> 01:02:50.260
[Shooter whistles]

01:02:51.729 --> 01:02:52.966
Car approaching!

01:03:06.448 --> 01:03:08.047
You invited guests?

01:03:25.101 --> 01:03:26.230
Hello.

01:03:26.895 --> 01:03:28.302
I'm Taliban.

01:03:28.404 --> 01:03:29.761
Nice to meet you.

01:03:31.639 --> 01:03:33.903
The Taliban think it's ISIS.

01:03:33.904 --> 01:03:35.470
You mustn't have left
witnesses.

01:03:36.380 --> 01:03:38.408
But Amir knows it wasn't.

01:03:38.409 --> 01:03:41.112
My friend heard
they're moving the girls.
She doesn't know where.

01:03:41.214 --> 01:03:44.251
Beautiful. No leader,
no weapons, and no target.

01:03:44.252 --> 01:03:45.986
We have weapons, some.

01:03:46.088 --> 01:03:48.015
They think ISIS
stole the weapons
to attack the prison.

01:03:48.117 --> 01:03:49.421
So they're moving the sheik.

01:03:49.422 --> 01:03:51.023
When?
[Awina] Soon.

01:03:51.125 --> 01:03:53.920
- Where?
- To the only
near maximum security prison.

01:03:53.921 --> 01:03:55.521
America built it.

01:03:55.623 --> 01:03:57.526
What was the stupidest plan
you came up with?

01:03:57.628 --> 01:04:00.261
- Nothing could have
topped that one.
- What was it? Come on!

01:04:00.262 --> 01:04:02.464
Break the sheik
out of prison and trade him.

01:04:03.331 --> 01:04:05.668
Amir wants money
and the sheik.

01:04:05.770 --> 01:04:07.098
We have the money.

01:04:07.099 --> 01:04:08.441
Let's get the sheik.

01:04:08.442 --> 01:04:10.476
And make Amir come to us.

01:04:10.477 --> 01:04:12.008
I always liked this plan.

01:04:12.110 --> 01:04:13.941
He's going to be
very heavily guarded.

01:04:13.942 --> 01:04:16.011
Yeah. I need your phone.

01:04:16.113 --> 01:04:17.952
I wasn't dumb enough
to bring it.

01:04:19.752 --> 01:04:21.516
Burn all our fake ID.

01:04:23.019 --> 01:04:24.317
If anyone is caught,

01:04:24.419 --> 01:04:26.651
just admit
you're an American soldier.

01:04:26.754 --> 01:04:29.161
Won't be pleasant, but
you'll eventually be traded.

01:04:29.660 --> 01:04:30.890
Got it?

01:04:30.992 --> 01:04:32.131
You weren't.

01:04:33.769 --> 01:04:36.300
No. But it's
the best chance we have.

01:04:49.814 --> 01:04:51.414

01:05:21.484 --> 01:05:22.844
So how will they know?

01:05:22.845 --> 01:05:24.348
When they see us.

01:05:25.216 --> 01:05:26.922
Well, I hope to God
they're ready.

01:05:47.609 --> 01:05:49.736
[shouting in Pashto]

01:06:00.555 --> 01:06:01.957
She's coming.

01:07:51.532 --> 01:07:52.597
Get into the car.

01:07:52.699 --> 01:07:54.168
What?
Go!

01:07:55.001 --> 01:07:57.171
I'm sorry, Rocky. I'm sorry.

01:07:58.872 --> 01:08:01.032

01:08:05.080 --> 01:08:07.206
Tell them
you're an American soldier.

01:08:07.308 --> 01:08:09.880
[panting] I am.

01:08:09.982 --> 01:08:11.383
Fucking right you are.

01:08:11.751 --> 01:08:13.044
Tell them.

01:08:20.928 --> 01:08:22.559
Abbas. [shouts in Pashto]

01:08:25.665 --> 01:08:26.860
Open up!

01:08:27.370 --> 01:08:28.565
Get in.

01:08:30.098 --> 01:08:31.062
Go!

01:08:47.049 --> 01:08:48.156
Abbas!

01:08:51.726 --> 01:08:53.051
[sobbing] Abbas.

01:09:14.807 --> 01:09:17.680
What he did worst,
he loved most.

01:09:18.619 --> 01:09:19.617
Singing?

01:09:19.719 --> 01:09:20.752
No.

01:09:20.753 --> 01:09:22.322
Singing was good.

01:09:23.285 --> 01:09:24.753
He loved driving.

01:09:25.990 --> 01:09:27.327
That he did.

01:09:29.425 --> 01:09:31.331
For you,
freedom is America.

01:09:32.593 --> 01:09:34.169
For him,
it was just driving.

01:09:50.181 --> 01:09:52.517
[footsteps approaching]

01:10:03.799 --> 01:10:05.057
You wanna talk about it?

01:10:06.535 --> 01:10:07.697
What?

01:10:11.134 --> 01:10:12.372
Not really.

01:10:22.110 --> 01:10:25.077
You start out
pretty early in life
knowing there is a...

01:10:26.855 --> 01:10:29.749
a line you won't cross.

01:10:29.851 --> 01:10:31.886
Things you'll do,
things you'll never do.

01:10:33.525 --> 01:10:36.360
You get into a tough spot,
the line shifts.

01:10:36.462 --> 01:10:38.662
You get in the real shit,
it shifts more.

01:10:41.727 --> 01:10:43.601
I will never eat a cat.

01:10:45.473 --> 01:10:47.501
Wait till you're starving
to death and they serve you

01:10:47.502 --> 01:10:49.607
the stray kitty
you've been petting.

01:10:52.079 --> 01:10:54.115
But there is still a line.

01:10:54.217 --> 01:10:57.010
Thick, dark and straight,
and the line holds.

01:11:00.082 --> 01:11:05.189
Till you find yourself
in a place
where the line just ends.

01:11:05.190 --> 01:11:09.693
Gone.
Every choice is unthinkable.

01:11:13.528 --> 01:11:16.370
Frank, our team leader,

01:11:17.833 --> 01:11:19.697
he held us together
for months in that hole.

01:11:19.698 --> 01:11:21.573
Every single one of us
loved him.

01:11:25.742 --> 01:11:28.876
He was about to die
a horrible death. Slow.

01:11:28.877 --> 01:11:32.386
His bones breaking
rock by rock,
thrown by his own men.

01:11:34.286 --> 01:11:36.148
They stood us in a circle.

01:11:36.759 --> 01:11:38.392
We all refused.

01:11:39.394 --> 01:11:42.161
So Amir sliced the throat
of a village woman.

01:11:42.263 --> 01:11:44.794
Let her bleed out,
kicking on the dirt.

01:11:45.691 --> 01:11:47.593
We still refused.

01:11:47.695 --> 01:11:49.568
He did the same to her kid.

01:11:53.570 --> 01:11:56.905
I was his second.
It was on me.

01:12:00.973 --> 01:12:03.450
So I picked up
a nice round rock,

01:12:04.084 --> 01:12:05.683
weighed it in my hand.

01:12:06.617 --> 01:12:08.580
And Frank
looked me right in the eye.

01:12:08.581 --> 01:12:11.821
Gave me this little smile.

01:12:13.463 --> 01:12:16.155
He'd seen me pitch
back at the base
when we played pickup.

01:12:18.224 --> 01:12:20.764
He turned his head
so that his temple was to me.

01:12:23.770 --> 01:12:27.930
And I wound up and I hurled
the fastest pitch I ever threw.

01:12:27.931 --> 01:12:30.169
I swear
I heard his skull crack.

01:12:35.148 --> 01:12:36.780
Just took the one rock.

01:12:40.589 --> 01:12:44.051
You do something like that,
you never find the line again.

01:12:47.955 --> 01:12:52.499
And that smile
haunts me every night.

01:12:56.867 --> 01:12:59.367
I thought I'd never
leave anyone else behind.

01:12:59.469 --> 01:13:01.002
[Geek] She's on the TV!

01:13:02.769 --> 01:13:04.874

01:13:11.181 --> 01:13:12.750
What?

01:13:12.852 --> 01:13:15.489
He says
she's an abomination,
not man or woman.

01:13:17.056 --> 01:13:18.184
Fuck you!

01:13:21.554 --> 01:13:22.555
What?

01:13:22.657 --> 01:13:24.154
And that she's ISIS.

01:13:24.155 --> 01:13:26.160
- They saw us right?
- [Jake] They saw us.

01:13:26.161 --> 01:13:28.700
[Bashir]
Because only ISIS would accept
a woman that is so degenerate.

01:13:28.802 --> 01:13:32.399
- This is bullshit!
- Come on, Rocky.
Speak English.

01:13:32.501 --> 01:13:35.334
[Bashir] And that she
and others have killed
many brave Taliban soldiers.

01:13:35.335 --> 01:13:36.609
Tell them.

01:13:39.011 --> 01:13:42.047
Now he's asking
if she has anything
to say in her defense.

01:13:42.149 --> 01:13:43.380
She won't.
She will.

01:13:43.482 --> 01:13:44.845
She'll tell them
she's American.

01:13:44.846 --> 01:13:47.016
- She promised me.
- She won't give us up.

01:13:47.017 --> 01:13:49.052
Our cover's already
been blown, they know it's us.
She knows that.

01:13:49.154 --> 01:13:50.117
She won't.

01:13:52.191 --> 01:13:53.593
Please, Rocky!

and his kindness.

- Is she dead?
- Unconscious.

01:14:59.757 --> 01:15:01.161
What the fuck?
You saved her life.

01:15:01.264 --> 01:15:03.830
I only thought I did.
[spits]

01:15:03.932 --> 01:15:07.095
She brought them to us then,
and she's bringing them
to us now.

01:15:07.594 --> 01:15:08.932
What?

01:15:09.934 --> 01:15:12.996
Fuck. She's been
updating them the entire time.

01:15:13.098 --> 01:15:15.169
How long do we have?
Minutes.

01:15:15.736 --> 01:15:16.841
Give me the phone.

01:15:17.806 --> 01:15:19.177
Get the cars on the road.

01:15:19.279 --> 01:15:20.344
Bring me the money.

01:15:20.446 --> 01:15:21.881
It's in the car.
Bring it.

01:15:21.984 --> 01:15:23.007
Leave it here.

01:15:23.109 --> 01:15:25.284
What about them?
We leave them.

01:15:25.285 --> 01:15:26.516
You're giving them
everything--

01:15:26.618 --> 01:15:28.182

Go where?

01:17:17.363 --> 01:17:19.090
To find my phone.

01:17:19.193 --> 01:17:21.266

Where is it?

01:17:21.368 --> 01:17:22.800
