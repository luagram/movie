18:43.802 --> 18:46.532
He's checking to see if you're still human.

18:47.472 --> 18:48.732
Look, I'm here to warn you.

18:49.941 --> 18:51.601
If your kind come on our land again...

18:52.377 --> 18:53.397
Wait, what?

18:56.247 --> 18:57.267
You didn't tell her?

18:57.682 --> 18:58.882
Just leave it alone, Jacob.

19:00.985 --> 19:01.965
Tell me what?

19:03.088 --> 19:06.058
Emmett and Paul had a misunderstanding.

19:06.324 --> 19:08.094
It's nothing to worry about.

19:08.159 --> 19:09.489
JACOB: Listen to you.

19:09.994 --> 19:11.694
Did you lie to get her out of town, too?

19:11.763 --> 19:13.493
You should just leave.

19:14.065 --> 19:15.085
Now.

19:15.901 --> 19:17.991
She has a right to know.

19:18.671 --> 19:20.231
She is the one the redhead wants.

19:22.375 --> 19:23.425
Victoria?

19:25.244 --> 19:26.874
Alice's vision.

19:27.913 --> 19:29.943
I was trying to protect you.

19:30.282 --> 19:31.942
By lying to me.

19:35.054 --> 19:37.724
Okay, we're gonna talk about this, but...

19:37.790 --> 19:38.920
You.

19:39.592 --> 19:41.962
Why haven't you called me back?

19:44.530 --> 19:46.460
I had nothing to say.

19:48.734 --> 19:51.234
- Well, I have tons. Hold on.
- Hey.

19:53.205 --> 19:54.535
Bella.

19:54.907 --> 19:56.527
Edward, you have to trust me.

19:56.609 --> 19:58.199
I do trust you.

19:58.878 --> 20:00.238
It's him I don't trust.

20:12.025 --> 20:14.855
Hey, lose the grin, Jacob.
We're just going for a ride.

20:14.928 --> 20:15.948
Hold on tight.

20:19.099 --> 20:20.929
(JONATHAN LOW PLAYING)

20:21.034 --> 20:24.094
Last born of the clan

20:24.171 --> 20:27.301
First one to be free

20:27.374 --> 20:30.374
Lived inside a house

20:30.444 --> 20:32.614
Are you sure this is a good idea?

20:34.681 --> 20:36.651
I am the vampire girl, remember?

20:37.818 --> 20:39.218
Hey, look who's back!

20:39.453 --> 20:40.443
What up, Bella?

20:40.520 --> 20:42.180
- Quil? You, too?
- Yep.

20:42.522 --> 20:43.682
Finally made the pack.

20:44.257 --> 20:45.277
EMBRY : I'm glad you're here, Bella.

20:45.358 --> 20:48.018
Maybe we can get a break
from Jake's obsessive inner monologue.

20:48.094 --> 20:49.194
"I wish Bella would call."

20:49.663 --> 20:50.993
"I wish Bella wouldn't call."

20:51.064 --> 20:53.864
- "Maybe I should call Bella."
- "Maybe I should call Bella and hang up."

20:53.935 --> 20:55.125
(ALL LAUGHING)

20:55.203 --> 20:57.333
All right, you can shut up now.

21:00.208 --> 21:03.738
Bella, this is Leah Clearwater,
Harry's daughter.

21:04.312 --> 21:07.342
Hey. I'm really sorry about your father.

21:07.782 --> 21:10.152
If you're here to torture Jacob some more,
feel free to leave.

21:13.921 --> 21:15.051
Fun, isn't she?

21:16.290 --> 21:18.880
- Bella, hi!
- Hey.

21:19.193 --> 21:22.063
I was wondering
when we'd see your face around here again.

21:22.129 --> 21:23.489
BELLA : Yeah. Same here.

21:23.664 --> 21:24.654
Sam, we good?

21:25.299 --> 21:28.389
We're good. She won't be getting
through our line any time soon.

21:28.469 --> 21:30.459
- Cool.
- Yeah, that's right boys!

21:39.747 --> 21:42.077
So when did Leah join the pack?

21:42.551 --> 21:46.211
Around when her dad died.
Her brother, Seth, also phased.

21:47.055 --> 21:50.315
He's only 15,
one of the youngest we've had.

21:51.193 --> 21:54.533
Sam keeps him home studying,
but he's chomping at the bit.

21:55.330 --> 21:57.130
I wish it was Leah who'd stay home.

21:58.333 --> 22:00.533
Come on, don't be such a guy.

22:00.602 --> 22:03.072
No, it's not a chick thing.

22:03.472 --> 22:06.242
It's, you know, a triangle thing.

22:06.875 --> 22:10.465
We all have to live
the LeahlSamlEmily pain-fest.

22:11.914 --> 22:13.254
Wolf telepathy, remember?

22:13.949 --> 22:16.079
So Sam dumps Leah for Emily?

22:16.752 --> 22:20.622
Yeah, it wasn't like that.
Sam hates himself for hurting Leah.

22:21.924 --> 22:23.954
But Emily was the one.

22:25.260 --> 22:28.060
I guess it sort of chooses you sometimes.

22:30.099 --> 22:32.029
It's more than some crush, Bella.

22:32.101 --> 22:34.261
Sam imprinted on Emily.

22:36.172 --> 22:38.372
Do I even want to know what that is?

22:47.550 --> 22:50.210
Imprinting on someone is like...

22:52.589 --> 22:54.649
Like when you see her,

22:55.925 --> 22:57.715
everything changes.

22:59.228 --> 23:03.028
All of a sudden,
it's not gravity holding you to the planet.

23:04.133 --> 23:05.433
It's her.

23:06.336 --> 23:08.196
Nothing else matters.

23:09.439 --> 23:11.459
You would do anything,

23:13.076 --> 23:14.806
be anything for her.

23:17.814 --> 23:20.084
Sounds like you know the feeling.

23:23.921 --> 23:25.251
Have you

23:27.358 --> 23:29.328
imprinted on someone?

23:34.431 --> 23:35.921
You'd know if I had.

23:40.104 --> 23:43.134
I just have a direct line to Sam's thoughts.

23:44.942 --> 23:46.672
So for now you're

23:47.211 --> 23:48.471
still you.

23:51.115 --> 23:53.135
And you're still you.

23:54.318 --> 23:55.478
Yeah.

24:01.025 --> 24:02.315
Until graduation.

24:04.128 --> 24:05.458
Graduation?

24:07.097 --> 24:08.827
You knew this was gonna happen.

24:08.900 --> 24:09.990
Not in a month!

24:12.504 --> 24:16.444
I mean, not before you've...
You've even lived.

24:17.909 --> 24:19.499
Or before I could...

24:19.944 --> 24:20.934
(CRASHING)

24:23.415 --> 24:27.145
For a second, just a second, I thought...

24:29.154 --> 24:31.384
But he's got his hooks in you so deep...

24:33.024 --> 24:34.864
I decided this, not him.

24:34.926 --> 24:37.286
Bella, they're not even alive.

24:38.296 --> 24:39.846
It makes me sick.

24:42.534 --> 24:45.334
Better you really be dead than one of them.

24:58.651 --> 25:00.081
I can't believe you said that.

25:04.757 --> 25:06.987
Edward was right, I shouldn't have come.

25:07.059 --> 25:09.959
Bella, come on. Please.

25:13.099 --> 25:14.289
I'm sorry.

26:24.037 --> 26:28.337
You know, Edward could
at least respect meal times.

26:29.142 --> 26:30.402
I was just with Jake.

26:31.278 --> 26:32.268
Oh.

26:33.547 --> 26:34.847
Good.

26:35.116 --> 26:36.206
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

26:39.453 --> 26:42.793
I'll just give you two some privacy, then.

26:45.126 --> 26:47.086
- Hey.
- Do you understand how worried I've been?

26:47.495 --> 26:48.925
I was perfectly safe.

26:48.996 --> 26:51.156
I almost broke the treaty to make sure.

26:52.233 --> 26:55.333
- I know I smell like a dog. I'm sorry.
- No, something's wrong.

27:02.510 --> 27:04.170
Edward, what's wrong?

27:04.245 --> 27:06.235
Someone's been in here.

27:11.419 --> 27:13.909
DR. CULLEN : Who was it?
Someone we know?

27:14.856 --> 27:17.946
This stranger, I didn't recognize his scent.

27:18.025 --> 27:19.685
A nomad passing through?

27:19.760 --> 27:21.730
A passerby wouldn't
have left Bella's father alive.

27:22.230 --> 27:26.130
The scent disappeared
about 5 miles south of Bella's house.

27:27.002 --> 27:28.902
Someone's orchestrating this.

27:28.971 --> 27:30.341
Victoria?

27:31.006 --> 27:32.556
I would have seen her decide.

27:32.808 --> 27:33.898
Has to be the Volturi.

27:34.610 --> 27:37.240
I don't think it's the Volturi, either.

27:37.312 --> 27:39.082
I've been watching Aro's decisions, too.

27:39.147 --> 27:40.477
EMMETT : So we keep looking.

27:40.549 --> 27:42.979
We'll also take shifts
guarding Bella at her house.

27:43.485 --> 27:44.875
Another protection detail?

27:45.387 --> 27:46.677
DR. CULLEN : Rosalie.

27:47.756 --> 27:48.746
No, she's right.

27:49.224 --> 27:53.664
You can't protect me, watch my dad
and search for the intruder.

27:53.729 --> 27:55.489
And for Victoria.

27:55.564 --> 27:57.234
And keep yourselves fed.

27:57.299 --> 27:59.099
I'm not leaving you here defenseless.

27:59.167 --> 28:01.727
Well, I'm not gonna let you starve.

28:02.204 --> 28:04.204
And I wouldn't be unprotected. I have...

28:06.208 --> 28:07.438
EDWARD : What?

28:15.318 --> 28:17.548
Whoever it was, he left his stink behind.

28:18.254 --> 28:21.994
It'll be hard to miss when we cross it again.
We'll handle it from here.

28:22.191 --> 28:24.851
We don't need you to handle anything.

28:24.928 --> 28:26.018
Or anyone.

28:26.095 --> 28:27.755
I could care less what you need.

28:27.830 --> 28:29.760
All right, we're done here.

28:29.832 --> 28:31.802
- No, you're done here.
- BELLA : Stop!

28:32.635 --> 28:36.125
I'm tired of this.
From now on, I'm Switzerland, okay?

28:37.473 --> 28:39.413
BELLA : Edward hated the idea,

28:39.475 --> 28:42.165
but it wasn't about rivalry anymore.

28:42.879 --> 28:45.609
It was about my safety, and Charlie's.

28:46.683 --> 28:51.123
In the days that followed,
I got them to at least try to work together.

28:56.025 --> 28:59.215
The wolves took over
so the Cullens could hunt.

29:01.699 --> 29:04.289
It wasn't exactly an easy alliance.

29:29.226 --> 29:31.346
I'm not gonna be gone long.

29:31.428 --> 29:33.988
Don't rush. You need to hunt.

29:50.715 --> 29:52.645
Maybe rush a little bit.

Bike, hike, just hang? Your call.

30:16.341 --> 30:18.241
But we're going to a party tonight.

30:21.112 --> 30:22.982
Are you sure this is okay?

30:23.581 --> 30:25.881
I really hate being a party crasher.

30:26.284 --> 30:28.984
Technically,
you're a council meeting crasher.

30:29.721 --> 30:34.391
You see? The council leaders,
Dad, Quil's grandpa and Sue Clearwater.

30:35.360 --> 30:37.350
She took over for Harry when he died.

30:37.429 --> 30:39.229
Okay, I should not be here.

30:39.899 --> 30:42.419
You're okay. I thought...

30:43.536 --> 30:47.226
I mean, they thought it would
be good for you to hear the histories.

30:47.306 --> 30:48.856
The histories?

30:49.442 --> 30:52.342
The tribe's histories? Aren't they secret?

30:53.179 --> 30:56.809
We all got a role to play,
and you're part of this.

30:57.616 --> 31:00.636
I mean, it's the first time
Seth, Leah and Quil'll hear them, too.

31:00.719 --> 31:03.879
But you are the first outsider. Ever.

31:06.292 --> 31:09.192
If I had known that, I would have, like...

31:10.096 --> 31:12.496
- I don't know, dressed better.
- SETH : Jake!

- Hey.
- It's about time you got here.

31:16.836 --> 31:19.856

but I saved you some burgers.

Good looking out, bro.

Bella, this is Seth Clearwater,
Leah's brother.

31:25.044 --> 31:26.384
- Hi.
- Newest member of the pack.

31:27.113 --> 31:29.213
Newest. Bestest. Brightest.

31:29.282 --> 31:30.772
And slowest.

- Come on, your dad's about to start.
- Okay.

31:37.791 --> 31:41.451
The Quileutes have been a small tribe
from the beginning,

31:42.095 --> 31:45.115
but we have always had magic in our blood.

31:46.833 --> 31:48.563
We were great spirit warriors,

31:49.202 --> 31:53.732
shape-shifters that transformed
to the powerful wolf.

31:55.675 --> 31:59.165
This enabled us to scare off our enemies

31:59.412 --> 32:01.512
and protect our tribe.

32:03.550 --> 32:08.110
One day,
our warriors came across a creature.

32:09.623 --> 32:11.653
It looked like a man,

32:11.725 --> 32:13.915
but it was hard like stone

32:14.694 --> 32:16.564
and cold as ice.

finally tore it apart,

32:45.493 --> 32:48.833
They lived in fear
that the cold man was not alone.

could see that he would lose.

courage.

long enough for Taha Aki to destroy her.

35:21.952 --> 35:24.012
I'm gonna need numbers.

35:25.389 --> 35:27.619
Seattle is in a state of terror.

35:27.691 --> 35:31.561
Police are baffled by
the escalating murders and disappearances.

35:31.629 --> 35:35.529
Theories range from a vicious new gang
to a wildly active serial killer.

35:35.600 --> 35:36.620
Reporting live...

35:36.701 --> 35:40.001
It's getting worse.
We're going to have to do something.

35:40.739 --> 35:44.509
It takes more than one of our kind
to cause the damage they're reporting.

35:44.776 --> 35:48.736
Quite a few more.
And they're undisciplined, conspicuous.

35:48.813 --> 35:50.183
It's newborns.

35:51.883 --> 35:53.713
What, like new vampires?

35:53.785 --> 35:55.805
In the first few months after the change.

35:55.887 --> 35:59.477
That's when
we're at our most uncontrollable. Vicious.

36:00.258 --> 36:02.018
Insane with thirst.

36:02.560 --> 36:04.820
Something to look forward to.

36:06.698 --> 36:09.758
No one's trained these newborns,
but this isn't random.

36:10.769 --> 36:12.759
Someone's creating an army.

36:13.138 --> 36:15.228
Well, now we're definitely going to Seattle.

36:16.307 --> 36:17.997
An army of vampires?

36:18.076 --> 36:20.066
And they've been created to fight someone.

36:20.145 --> 36:21.835
We're the only clan even close to Seattle.

DR. CULLEN : Regardless of why
they were made,

36:23.449 --> 36:26.579
if we don't put a stop to them,
the Volturi will.

36:26.652 --> 36:28.712
I'm surprised they've let it go on this long.

36:28.788 --> 36:30.218
Maybe they're behind it.

36:31.490 --> 36:34.190
In Italy, I read Aro's mind.

36:34.260 --> 36:36.020
He wants me and Alice to join him,

36:36.095 --> 36:39.255
but he knows we'll never choose him
as long as our family's still alive.

36:39.331 --> 36:41.991
An army could solve that for him.

36:50.643 --> 36:51.803
Hey.

37:39.960 --> 37:42.490
why they'll never see me again.

37:42.729 --> 37:46.559
After a few decades,
everyone you know will be dead.

37:49.302 --> 37:50.632
Problem solved.

37:55.842 --> 37:58.332
Why are you so against
me becoming like you?

37:58.880 --> 38:00.470
I've told you.

38:03.551 --> 38:05.281
Be honest with me.

38:06.587 --> 38:08.047
There's more.

I know the consequences
of this choice you're making.

38:18.232 --> 38:19.632
I've lived through it.

38:21.502 --> 38:24.132
And to let you suffer that...

38:25.673 --> 38:29.273
You believe I have a soul, and I don't.

38:32.780 --> 38:34.370
But to risk yours,

38:34.448 --> 38:37.538
just for the sake of
never having to lose you,

38:39.854 --> 38:42.124
that's the most selfish thing I'll ever do.

38:46.527 --> 38:50.517
I thought that you were afraid
that I'd be too different.

38:52.701 --> 38:57.901

and I wouldn't smell the same.

39:44.520 --> 39:46.610
BELLA : Gosh, it's so pretty here.

39:52.195 --> 39:55.255
So, Alice has planned
a big graduation party.

39:56.399 --> 39:57.489
Which you're invited to.

40:02.205 --> 40:04.865
Yeah, I figured that.

40:12.615 --> 40:13.775

40:15.752 --> 40:18.282
I just wanted to do this differently.

40:18.688 --> 40:20.018

40:21.591 --> 40:23.531
But now I'm out of time.

40:24.862 --> 40:26.162

40:27.031 --> 40:29.661
You need to hear the truth, Bella,

40:30.300 --> 40:32.630

40:34.204 --> 40:35.974
And you need to know

40:37.541 --> 40:39.771
that I'm in love with you,

40:41.245 --> 40:44.265
and I want you to choose me
instead of him.

- I don't buy it.

You feel something else for me.
You just won't admit it.

41:04.268 --> 41:06.238
So I'm not giving up.

I'm gonna fight for you

Well, then you're not gonna
have to fight for long.

you're afraid you'll change your mind.

- No. I think you pretty much nailed it.
- JESSICA : Yeah?

51:57.601 --> 51:59.901
It's like I was born to lead, right?

51:59.970 --> 52:01.730
I love this song! Let's go.

52:01.905 --> 52:03.495
(UPBEAT SONG PLAYING)

52:26.663 --> 52:27.993
What are you doing here?

52:28.465 --> 52:30.325
You invited me, remember?

52:31.101 --> 52:35.041
Was my right hook too subtle for you?
That was me uninviting you.

52:35.873 --> 52:39.443
Look, Bella, I'm sorry about, you know,

52:40.979 --> 52:43.449
the kiss and your hand.

52:44.349 --> 52:48.479
I'd blame it on the whole inner animal thing,
but it was really just me

52:49.120 --> 52:50.820
being an ass.

52:51.589 --> 52:53.019
I'm really sorry.

52:54.659 --> 52:56.489
I brought you something.

52:56.795 --> 53:00.055
A graduation present. I made it myself.

53:00.965 --> 53:02.395
BELLA : Wow.

53:02.867 --> 53:04.157
You made this?

53:05.136 --> 53:06.726
It's really pretty.

53:07.005 --> 53:08.395
Thanks.

53:23.154 --> 53:24.214
I'll be right back.

53:27.293 --> 53:30.493
- Alice, what'd you see?
- The decision's been made.

53:30.563 --> 53:32.123
What's going on?

53:32.198 --> 53:34.688
- You're not going to Seattle.
- No.

53:35.868 --> 53:37.768
They're coming here.

53:38.370 --> 53:39.960
ALICE : They'll be here in four days.

53:40.039 --> 53:41.939
This could turn into a bloodbath.

53:42.107 --> 53:43.127
Who's behind it?

53:43.209 --> 53:45.679
I didn't see anyone I recognized.

53:46.278 --> 53:47.268
Maybe one.

53:48.447 --> 53:51.847
I know his face. He's local. Riley Biers.

53:52.685 --> 53:53.705
He didn't start this.

53:53.786 --> 53:55.776
Whoever did is staying out of the action.

53:56.121 --> 53:58.491
They must be playing with the blind spots
in your vision.

53:58.557 --> 54:00.527
JASPER : Either way, the army is coming

54:00.593 --> 54:02.223
and there aren't enough of us
to protect the town.

54:02.294 --> 54:05.204
Hold up. What damn army?

54:05.264 --> 54:07.234
Newborns. Our kind.

54:07.466 --> 54:08.586
What are they after?

54:08.834 --> 54:10.734
They were passing around Bella's scent.

54:11.136 --> 54:12.426
A red blouse.

54:12.505 --> 54:15.865
They're after Bella?
What the hell does this mean?

54:15.942 --> 54:18.842
It means an ugly fight. With lives lost.

54:23.984 --> 54:26.184
All right. We're in.

54:26.620 --> 54:29.680
No. You'd get yourselves killed. No way.

54:30.223 --> 54:32.493
I wasn't asking for permission.

54:33.093 --> 54:34.493
Edward?

54:38.331 --> 54:39.821
It means more protection for you.

54:41.234 --> 54:45.904
Jacob, do you believe
Sam would agree to an understanding?

54:47.641 --> 54:50.271
As long as we get to kill some vampires.

54:50.343 --> 54:51.373
DR. CULLEN : Jasper?

54:51.444 --> 54:53.474
They'll give us the numbers.

54:54.681 --> 54:58.671
Newborns won't know they even exist.
That'll give us an edge.

54:58.752 --> 55:00.192
We'll need to coordinate.

55:00.253 --> 55:04.093
- Carlisle, they're gonna get hurt.
- We'll all need some training.

55:04.157 --> 55:07.127
Fighting newborns requires knowledge
that Jasper has.

55:07.194 --> 55:09.294
You're welcome to join us.

55:10.631 --> 55:13.731
All right. Name the time and place.

55:13.801 --> 55:17.641
Jake, you don't know
what you're getting yourself into.

55:19.073 --> 55:20.443
Bella,

55:21.042 --> 55:22.942
this is what we do.

55:23.477 --> 55:24.807
You should be happy.

55:25.446 --> 55:28.106
Look at us, working together.

55:28.583 --> 55:32.113
You are the one who wanted us
to get along. Remember?

55:41.662 --> 55:42.892
Again!

55:56.011 --> 55:58.211
It's a graduation present.

56:14.730 --> 56:16.030
(GROWLING)

56:17.366 --> 56:20.156
They don't trust us enough
to be in their human forms.

56:20.235 --> 56:22.355
They came. That's what matters.

56:23.639 --> 56:25.399
Will you translate?

56:30.445 --> 56:31.735
Hey, Jake.

56:37.853 --> 56:39.253
Welcome.

56:41.456 --> 56:45.256
Jasper has experience with newborns.
He'll teach us how to defeat them.

56:48.698 --> 56:50.358
They want to know
how the newborns differ from us.

56:51.868 --> 56:53.458
They're a great deal stronger than us

56:53.536 --> 56:56.396
because their own human blood
lingers in their tissues.

56:57.173 --> 57:00.273
Our kind is never more physically powerful

57:00.743 --> 57:02.943
than in our first several months of this life.

57:06.482 --> 57:10.282
Carlisle's right. That's why they are created.

57:11.654 --> 57:15.564
A newborn army doesn't need thousands
like a human army,

57:16.159 --> 57:18.749
but no human army
could stand against them.

57:20.396 --> 57:23.486
Now, the two most important things
to remember are, first,

57:23.566 --> 57:26.996
never let them get their arms around you.
They'll crush you instantly.

57:27.070 --> 57:28.630
And second,

57:29.872 --> 57:32.642
never go for the obvious kill.

57:34.144 --> 57:36.374
They'll be expecting that,

57:36.980 --> 57:39.240
and you will lose.

57:39.383 --> 57:40.583
(WITH YOU IN MY HEAD PLAYING)

57:40.818 --> 57:42.048
Emmett.

57:44.221 --> 57:47.521
Even if they stick to humming

57:47.591 --> 57:49.121
Holding on a song to see them

57:49.193 --> 57:51.923
- Don't hold back.
- Not in my nature.

57:51.995 --> 57:54.015
Sick of, sick of, sick of love

57:56.200 --> 58:02.470
When you went down, the men came callin'

58:02.539 --> 58:06.769
Changing to stone as you wept from fallin'

58:06.844 --> 58:08.514
Never lose focus.

58:15.385 --> 58:19.215
When you went down, the men came callin'

58:21.426 --> 58:25.486
Changing to stone as you wept from fallin'

58:29.534 --> 58:30.874
One more thing.

58:31.736 --> 58:34.296
Never turn your back on your enemy.

58:34.372 --> 58:38.102
Singing in tones that makes things summer

58:45.850 --> 58:48.980
I got the skills

58:49.053 --> 58:54.553
I'm in love with you

58:54.626 --> 58:58.526
Everything you taught me, honey

58:58.596 --> 59:00.716
It never even mattered really

59:00.799 --> 59:06.969
This song's about my love for you

59:21.587 --> 59:23.917
Some of you are gonna get hurt.

59:26.592 --> 59:29.722
Some of you could get killed
because of me.

59:33.132 --> 59:35.932
It's gonna be 100 times worse
than this, right?

59:43.209 --> 59:44.939
(GRUNTING)

59:58.592 --> 1:00:00.062
Done for the day.

1:00:13.240 --> 1:00:14.540
Jasper?

1:00:17.811 --> 1:00:20.611
Are you sure
there's nothing I can do to help?

1:00:20.680 --> 1:00:24.210
Well, your presence alone, your scent,
will distract the newborns.

1:00:24.284 --> 1:00:28.314
Their hunting instinct will take over
and drive them crazy.

1:00:29.823 --> 1:00:31.923
Good. I'm glad.

1:00:34.060 --> 1:00:37.430
Hey. How do you know so much about this?

1:00:39.432 --> 1:00:43.492
I didn't have quite the same upbringing
as my adopted siblings.

1:00:49.877 --> 1:00:53.137
- Those bites are like mine.
- Battle scars.

1:00:55.483 --> 1:00:58.153
All the training
the Confederate Army gave me

1:00:58.219 --> 1:01:00.689
was useless against the newborns.

1:01:01.455 --> 1:01:04.285
Still, I never lost a fight.

1:01:10.197 --> 1:01:13.217
This happened during the Civil War?

1:01:13.301 --> 1:01:16.031
I was the youngest major
in the Texas cavalry,

1:01:16.103 --> 1:01:18.803
all without having seen any real battle.

1:01:18.873 --> 1:01:20.033
Until?

1:01:22.043 --> 1:01:23.913
Till I met a certain immortal.

1:01:24.845 --> 1:01:26.305
Maria.

1:01:31.152 --> 1:01:32.452
I was riding back to Galveston

1:01:32.520 --> 1:01:35.150
after evacuating a column
of women and children

1:01:35.991 --> 1:01:37.191
when I saw them.

1:01:38.393 --> 1:01:40.163
I immediately offered them my aid.

1:01:48.170 --> 1:01:50.640
Lovely. And an officer.

1:01:51.340 --> 1:01:52.600
(HORSE WHINNYING)

1:01:58.213 --> 1:02:02.843
You'd better do it, Maria.
I can never stop once I've started.

1:02:06.388 --> 1:02:10.118
- What's your name, soldier?
- Major Jasper Whitlock, ma'am.

1:02:11.093 --> 1:02:12.863
I hope you survive.

1:02:13.962 --> 1:02:16.592
You may be of great use to me.

1:02:22.070 --> 1:02:23.900
- Maria was creating an army?
- They were very common in the South.

1:02:26.309 --> 1:02:29.469
There were constant brutal battles
for territory.

1:02:30.113 --> 1:02:31.843
Maria won them all.

1:02:33.049 --> 1:02:37.679
She was smart, careful, and she had me.

1:02:38.554 --> 1:02:39.854
(GRUNTING)

1:02:40.456 --> 1:02:42.746
I was her second in command.

1:02:43.326 --> 1:02:46.316
My ability to control emotions
served her well.

1:02:48.131 --> 1:02:49.601
I trained her newborns,

1:02:49.966 --> 1:02:51.516
(BOTH GRUNTING)

1:02:53.169 --> 1:02:57.769
an endless occupation since she never
let them live beyond their first year.

1:03:00.543 --> 1:03:03.013
It was my job to dispose of them.

1:03:23.600 --> 1:03:26.030
I could feel everything they felt.

1:03:27.438 --> 1:03:28.598
(GROANING)

1:03:38.982 --> 1:03:41.752
I thought what Maria and I had was love.

1:03:43.153 --> 1:03:46.883
But I was her puppet.
She pulled the strings.

1:03:49.026 --> 1:03:50.956
I didn't know there was another way

1:03:53.363 --> 1:03:55.163
till I found Alice.

1:03:56.967 --> 1:03:59.297
Now, she'd seen me coming, of course.

1:03:59.770 --> 1:04:01.860
You kept me waiting long enough.

1:04:05.810 --> 1:04:07.510
My apologies, ma'am.

1:04:09.514 --> 1:04:11.814
I don't know what I'd have become
without her.

1:04:11.883 --> 1:04:12.873
(SHUSHING)

1:04:14.252 --> 1:04:16.652
You never have to be that again.

1:04:31.302 --> 1:04:34.532
(WHISPERING IN SPANISH)

1:04:44.616 --> 1:04:45.666
Jasper.

1:04:47.051 --> 1:04:49.021
I want you to do something for me.

1:04:49.087 --> 1:04:51.387
Kill her.

1:05:01.000 --> 1:05:01.990
(SCREAMS)

1:05:05.871 --> 1:05:07.001
What is it?

1:05:10.643 --> 1:05:12.173
The intruder,

1:05:13.812 --> 1:05:15.472
the newborn army,

1:05:17.750 --> 1:05:20.050
they're all her puppets.

1:05:22.188 --> 1:05:23.418
Victoria.

1:05:24.623 --> 1:05:27.893
Alice would have seen
if she wanted to make an army.

1:05:27.960 --> 1:05:32.760
Unless she's hiding behind them
and she's letting someone else decide.

1:06:02.028 --> 1:06:03.888
Welcome to the army.

1:06:07.367 --> 1:06:08.357
(SCREAMING)

1:06:13.173 --> 1:06:16.873
I'm not just gonna hide
while you're out taking all the risks for me.

1:06:17.677 --> 1:06:21.077
If it's Victoria involved, I need to keep you
as far away from the fight as possible.

1:06:21.147 --> 1:06:24.607
- Jasper said that I could be of help.
- We won't need your help.

1:06:24.684 --> 1:06:27.524
With the wolves in this, it's an easy win.

1:06:27.587 --> 1:06:30.217
The rest of us
aren't gonna have enough to do.

1:06:30.291 --> 1:06:32.661
Okay.
Either it's so dangerous that I have to hide

1:06:32.727 --> 1:06:34.747
or it's so easy
that you're gonna be sidelined. Which is it?

1:06:34.829 --> 1:06:37.319
It's dangerous for you, it's easy for us.

1:06:39.267 --> 1:06:43.927
I think it's dangerous for us to be apart.
How many times do we have to prove that?

1:06:44.972 --> 1:06:49.712
I'll be worried. You'll be worried.
And we'll both be more vulnerable.

1:06:52.313 --> 1:06:54.043
Okay, you're right.

1:06:54.749 --> 1:06:58.309
- So I'm coming with you.
- No, we both stay away together.

1:06:58.753 --> 1:07:01.623
I can't make you choose
between me and your family.

1:07:01.689 --> 1:07:04.719
The only way I can protect you
is to be with you.

1:07:08.929 --> 1:07:12.989
You're not fighting?
What, did you pull a muscle or something?

1:07:13.067 --> 1:07:15.467
- He's doing it for me, okay?
- Whatever.

1:07:16.837 --> 1:07:18.067
Just tell me the plan.

1:07:19.007 --> 1:07:20.977
This field will give us
an advantage in battle.

1:07:21.043 --> 1:07:23.843
We need to lure the newborns
with Bella's scent,

1:07:24.579 --> 1:07:26.339
but it needs to end here.

1:07:26.415 --> 1:07:28.035
Edward and I are going to a campsite.

1:07:28.116 --> 1:07:31.446
Even if he carries me,
they'll still pick up on our scents.

1:07:31.520 --> 1:07:33.490
Your stench, however, is revolting.

1:07:33.555 --> 1:07:35.675
Dude, you really
don't wanna start comparing stinks.

1:07:35.757 --> 1:07:39.347
What he means is that your scent
will mask mine if you carry me.

1:07:40.228 --> 1:07:43.248
- Done.
- This is not a good idea.

1:07:43.332 --> 1:07:48.332
Edward, they won't want
to get anywhere near his odor.

1:07:48.603 --> 1:07:50.593
Okay. Let's just try it.

1:07:53.375 --> 1:07:55.735
- Eau de wolf coming up.
- Run.

1:08:06.054 --> 1:08:08.624
So you gonna ask me
to sit out of the fight, too?

1:08:08.691 --> 1:08:10.821
Or don't you care about my safety?

1:08:11.294 --> 1:08:16.734
- Of course, I care. But you'd say no.
- I won't have a choice, anyways.

1:08:17.967 --> 1:08:22.267
Since I let Sam be alpha male,
I gotta live with the shots he calls.

1:08:23.506 --> 1:08:25.406
Since you let Sam be alpha?

1:08:26.676 --> 1:08:30.476
I didn't wanna be in a pack,
let alone be its leader.

1:08:32.348 --> 1:08:33.438
Wow.

1:08:34.951 --> 1:08:37.921
- Chief Jacob.
- Opted out.

1:08:39.055 --> 1:08:41.345
But every choice has its consequences.

1:08:41.924 --> 1:08:44.484
- Some more than others.
- Don't start.

1:08:44.994 --> 1:08:47.964
Everybody makes choices.
You're gonna have to accept mine.

1:08:48.030 --> 1:08:51.430
But you can love
more than one person at a time.

1:08:51.501 --> 1:08:55.131
I've seen it. With Sam, Emily and Leah.

1:08:56.673 --> 1:09:01.613
- Well, I'm not a wolf. I can't imprint.
- It has nothing to do with imprinting.

1:09:02.780 --> 1:09:06.410
It has to do with feeling something
for somebody.

1:09:07.050 --> 1:09:09.680
And I know you feel something for me.

1:09:10.888 --> 1:09:14.018
I can sense how I make you feel, physically.

1:09:15.893 --> 1:09:17.663
I make you nervous.

1:09:21.965 --> 1:09:23.185
Jake.

1:09:25.269 --> 1:09:26.699
Don't worry.

1:09:27.638 --> 1:09:31.008
I promised I wouldn't kiss you again
till you asked.

1:09:31.642 --> 1:09:35.242
You're gonna be keeping that promise
for a while, chief.

1:09:38.248 --> 1:09:41.778
All I picked up was wolf stench. No Bella.

1:09:45.023 --> 1:09:47.463
- This will work.
- Great.

1:09:52.430 --> 1:09:53.990
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)

1:09:55.533 --> 1:09:57.233
Yes. Scout's honor.

1:09:58.002 --> 1:10:00.902
- Okay, Alice, don't be a stranger.
- Okay.

1:10:02.607 --> 1:10:05.597
- Your alibi for the battle is all arranged.
- Really?

1:10:06.110 --> 1:10:08.810
I told your father that our whole family's
going camping this weekend,

1:10:08.880 --> 1:10:11.310
so you and I are having a sleepover
at my house.

1:10:12.584 --> 1:10:15.424
- Charlie's going fishing, anyway.
- Charlie?

1:10:15.954 --> 1:10:19.394
- You guys are on first name basis now?
- Me, he likes.

1:10:20.959 --> 1:10:24.189
Actually, you and Edward
will have the house to yourself tonight.

1:10:27.765 --> 1:10:28.815
Like alone?

1:10:29.601 --> 1:10:33.091
We're all going hunting.
Powering up for the battle.

1:10:35.841 --> 1:10:36.931
You're welcome.

1:10:39.144 --> 1:10:42.914
- Hey. You want a sandwich?
- No, I'm good.

1:10:44.984 --> 1:10:46.984
Well, the sister, I like.

1:10:48.153 --> 1:10:51.053
Alice. Yeah, she's great.

1:10:59.031 --> 1:11:01.001
Hey, Dad, I was wondering.

1:11:02.535 --> 1:11:05.595
Why didn't you get remarried? After Mom.

1:11:10.042 --> 1:11:14.782
I don't know.
Guess I still haven't met the right gal.

1:11:17.182 --> 1:11:19.282
- Why?
- I don't know.

1:11:22.589 --> 1:11:26.619
I thought you just maybe gave up
on the whole institution of it,

1:11:27.761 --> 1:11:29.191
of marriage.

1:11:30.997 --> 1:11:32.617
But do you think there's any value in it?

1:11:34.901 --> 1:11:37.931
Yeah. Yeah, marriage has value.

1:11:40.006 --> 1:11:41.596
When you're older.

1:11:42.609 --> 1:11:43.869
Much older.

1:11:46.079 --> 1:11:47.669
Like your mother.

1:11:48.081 --> 1:11:50.481
It seemed to work out fine for her
the second time around,

1:11:50.550 --> 1:11:53.450
- later in life.
- Yeah, I guess.

1:11:56.056 --> 1:12:00.386
I mean, you definitely don't wanna
have to get married because you weren't

1:12:01.461 --> 1:12:02.861
careful.

1:12:04.831 --> 1:12:08.271
- What?
- Look, you know what I'm talking about.

1:12:09.669 --> 1:12:12.899
There's things you need to think about
if you're gonna be physically intimate.

1:12:12.974 --> 1:12:15.574
Okay. Don't have "the talk" with me, please.

1:12:15.643 --> 1:12:18.203
Well, it's just as embarrassing for me
as it is for you.

1:12:18.279 --> 1:12:19.639
I doubt that.

1:12:19.714 --> 1:12:22.154
And don't bother,
'cause Mom beat you to it like 10 years ago.

1:12:22.216 --> 1:12:24.116
Well, you didn't have a boyfriend
10 years ago.

1:12:24.185 --> 1:12:26.585
I'm sure things work the same way.

1:12:28.923 --> 1:12:30.623
All right, so...

1:12:32.526 --> 1:12:34.956
You guys are taking precautions and...

1:12:35.029 --> 1:12:37.999
Okay, Dad, please,
just don't worry about that.

1:12:39.066 --> 1:12:42.086
Edward is old school.

1:12:44.438 --> 1:12:48.028
Old school. Great. What's that?
Like, code for something?

1:12:48.109 --> 1:12:50.769
Oh, my God. Dad. I'm a virgin.

1:12:51.779 --> 1:12:55.339
- Okay! Good. Glad we covered that.
- Me, too.

1:12:59.888 --> 1:13:01.218
Virgin.

1:13:02.824 --> 1:13:05.124
I'm liking Edward a little bit more now.

1:13:16.004 --> 1:13:18.234
What are you doing outside?
What's wrong?

1:13:19.508 --> 1:13:20.738
Nothing.

1:13:40.529 --> 1:13:43.329
It seems only fair
that I be represented, as well.

1:13:47.936 --> 1:13:49.766
It's really pretty.

1:13:50.973 --> 1:13:52.033
Thanks.

1:14:00.416 --> 1:14:01.906
There's a bed.

1:14:03.219 --> 1:14:05.649
I thought you might need one to sleep in.

1:14:07.990 --> 1:14:10.580
I think an air mattress would have sufficed.

1:14:10.660 --> 1:14:13.560
- Is this too much?
- No.

1:14:14.731 --> 1:14:16.431
No, it's perfect.

1:14:18.034 --> 1:14:21.474
- I wanna ask you something.
- Anything.

1:14:25.708 --> 1:14:29.038
Okay, marriage is the condition for you
to change me yourself, right?

1:14:31.948 --> 1:14:33.038
Yes.

1:14:36.018 --> 1:14:39.078
Okay. I wanna negotiate my own condition.

1:14:41.191 --> 1:14:43.521
Anything you want. It's yours.

1:14:45.562 --> 1:14:47.192
You promise?

1:14:48.632 --> 1:14:49.832
Yeah.

1:14:53.837 --> 1:14:55.167
Okay.

1:15:01.712 --> 1:15:02.772
Hey.

1:15:11.588 --> 1:15:12.888
Bella.

1:15:13.957 --> 1:15:15.147
No.

1:15:15.225 --> 1:15:17.515
But you said that you wanted me
to have every human experience.

1:15:17.594 --> 1:15:20.764
- Not ones that will risk killing you.
- You won't.

1:15:22.966 --> 1:15:26.056
And everyone says once I'm changed
all I'll want is to slaughter the whole town.

1:15:27.438 --> 1:15:30.528
- That part doesn't last forever.
- I want you.

1:15:32.944 --> 1:15:37.184
While I'm still me.
While I still want you this way.

1:15:41.920 --> 1:15:46.910
- It's too dangerous.
- Try. Just try.

1:15:49.794 --> 1:15:54.204
I'll go to some ridiculously expensive
college and let you buy me a car.

1:15:54.265 --> 1:15:56.495
I'll marry you. Just try.

1:15:57.035 --> 1:15:59.365
(MY LOVE PLAYING)

1:15:59.804 --> 1:16:02.714
You were searching

1:16:03.608 --> 1:16:07.438
For release

1:16:08.146 --> 1:16:11.576
You took my hand

1:16:11.983 --> 1:16:15.653
Added a plan

1:16:15.721 --> 1:16:19.891
You gave me your heart

1:16:26.799 --> 1:16:33.729
I know you're pleased to go

1:16:37.877 --> 1:16:40.367
Stop trying to take your clothes off.

1:16:40.446 --> 1:16:43.106
- You wanna do that part?
- Not tonight.

1:17:03.502 --> 1:17:04.662
You...

1:17:08.174 --> 1:17:10.114
You mean, you don't...

1:17:12.078 --> 1:17:13.168
(SIGHING) That's fine.

1:17:16.583 --> 1:17:18.713
Believe me, I want to.

1:17:20.887 --> 1:17:22.817
I just want to be married to you first.

1:17:26.192 --> 1:17:28.492
You really make me feel
like I'm some sort of villain

1:17:28.561 --> 1:17:31.661
trying to steal your virtue or something.

1:17:34.067 --> 1:17:36.257
It's not my virtue I'm concerned about.

1:17:38.672 --> 1:17:40.332
Are you kidding?

1:17:40.907 --> 1:17:44.927
It's just one rule I wanna leave unbroken.

1:17:47.280 --> 1:17:51.010
It might be too late for my soul,
but I will protect yours.

1:17:52.185 --> 1:17:54.875
I know that's not a modern notion.

1:17:54.956 --> 1:17:58.116
It's not modern. It's ancient.

1:18:01.228 --> 1:18:03.288
I'm from a different era.

1:18:05.633 --> 1:18:09.163
Things were a lot less complicated.

1:18:11.405 --> 1:18:15.865
And if I'd have met you back then,
I would have courted you.

1:18:18.079 --> 1:18:23.239
We'd have taken chaperoned strolls
and iced tea on the porch.

1:18:34.061 --> 1:18:36.431
I may have stolen a kiss or two,

1:18:37.531 --> 1:18:42.471
but only after asking
your father's permission.

1:18:44.773 --> 1:18:46.333
I would have got down on one knee,

1:18:53.215 --> 1:18:56.175
and I would have
presented you with a ring.

1:19:03.258 --> 1:19:04.348
This was my mother's.

1:19:08.630 --> 1:19:13.590
Isabella Swan, I promise to love you
every moment of forever.

1:19:14.770 --> 1:19:18.430
And would you do me
the extraordinary honor of marrying me?

1:19:24.312 --> 1:19:25.682
Yes.

1:19:47.537 --> 1:19:49.627
You're not coming with us?

1:19:58.214 --> 1:20:00.714
It'll be a last minute decision.

1:20:02.718 --> 1:20:07.948
- I told you how it works.
- The Cullens have powers.

1:20:09.158 --> 1:20:13.858
Don't underestimate them, Riley.
You'll have the numbers,

1:20:14.831 --> 1:20:20.031
but they'll be able
to anticipate your every move.

1:20:21.438 --> 1:20:24.198
- According to your friend?
- Yes.

1:20:24.808 --> 1:20:27.678
My dead friend.

1:20:30.447 --> 1:20:33.707
Laurent found out about the things
they could do,

1:20:35.719 --> 1:20:37.549
and they killed him.

1:20:39.423 --> 1:20:41.623
But not before he told me.

1:20:46.763 --> 1:20:48.593
Maybe he was wrong.

1:20:51.668 --> 1:20:58.158
I mean, this is supposed to be
Cullen territory.

1:20:59.276 --> 1:21:03.206
We've been tearing it up
and I've never even seen them here.

1:21:04.248 --> 1:21:06.008
You don't trust me.

1:21:07.217 --> 1:21:11.747
- With my life. I'm just saying...
- I'm doing this for us.

1:21:11.823 --> 1:21:16.893
So that we can feed
without their retaliation.

1:21:16.961 --> 1:21:20.731
I can't live in fear anymore,
waiting for them to attack.

1:21:20.798 --> 1:21:22.488
I won't let them.

1:21:23.668 --> 1:21:28.438
I am going to end the Cullen clan.

1:21:31.309 --> 1:21:32.709
I swear.

1:21:49.894 --> 1:21:53.234
I love you so much.

1:22:13.852 --> 1:22:15.252
You're going overboard.

1:22:15.854 --> 1:22:18.414
If this is all I can contribute,
I wanna be thorough.

1:22:18.490 --> 1:22:20.720
The newborns'll be frantic.

1:22:22.928 --> 1:22:26.328
It's okay.
Don't make yourself uncomfortable.

1:22:26.398 --> 1:22:27.728
It doesn't bother me anymore.

1:22:29.835 --> 1:22:31.025
Since when?

1:22:31.503 --> 1:22:34.533
Since I spent 24 hours
thinking you were dead.

1:22:36.175 --> 1:22:38.405
You're not wearing your ring.

1:22:39.912 --> 1:22:42.282
Well, I didn't want to risk losing it.

1:22:44.149 --> 1:22:45.639
Or risk Jacob seeing it.

1:22:48.888 --> 1:22:52.788
I think we should wait to tell him.
I mean, at least till after the fight.

1:22:52.859 --> 1:22:55.489
- If you're having second thoughts...
- I'm not.

1:22:55.562 --> 1:22:59.662
- I just want him to have a clear head.
- Whose head is unclear?

1:23:01.201 --> 1:23:02.901
Nobody's I hope.

1:23:03.903 --> 1:23:06.873
- Alice says there's a storm coming.
- Yeah, I can feel it.

1:23:08.108 --> 1:23:09.908
We should get going.

1:23:11.044 --> 1:23:13.514
I'll see you in a couple of hours.

1:23:22.789 --> 1:23:24.259
Something up?

1:23:27.193 --> 1:23:30.893
- Bunch of vampires trying to kill me.
- Same old same old.

1:24:48.877 --> 1:24:49.967
Thank you.

1:24:52.547 --> 1:24:55.607
- You should get back before the storm hits.
- No, I'm staying.

1:24:56.351 --> 1:24:59.081
You'll need my connection to the pack
to keep tabs on what's going on.

1:24:59.154 --> 1:25:02.684
- You're not gonna fight?
- Seth will spell me in the morning.

1:25:03.058 --> 1:25:05.988
He's not happy about missing the action
but it'll keep him out of trouble.

1:25:07.763 --> 1:25:09.323
Let's get you inside.

1:25:22.512 --> 1:25:23.952
(WHIMPERING)

1:25:27.517 --> 1:25:32.677
- I should have chosen a site lower down.
- No, it's fine. I'm okay.

1:25:33.356 --> 1:25:34.946
What can I do?

1:25:40.830 --> 1:25:42.300
(WIND HOWLING)

1:25:47.703 --> 1:25:51.003
I can't sleep
with all that teeth chattering going on.

1:25:58.281 --> 1:26:02.511
- Forget it.
- She may need her toes someday.

1:26:03.787 --> 1:26:07.117
And let's face it, I am hotter than you.

1:26:12.196 --> 1:26:17.066
- Get your hand off me.
- Keep your hands off her.

1:26:17.568 --> 1:26:19.058
Don't fight.

1:26:22.439 --> 1:26:24.239
If she gets sick, it's on you.

1:26:41.291 --> 1:26:43.491
Wow, you're freezing, Bella.

1:26:44.595 --> 1:26:48.045
Relax. You'll warm up soon.

1:26:49.633 --> 1:26:52.193
Faster if you took your clothes off.

1:26:52.270 --> 1:26:54.930
- Jake.
- Survival 101.

1:27:26.638 --> 1:27:29.868
Can you at least attempt
to control your thoughts?

1:27:32.277 --> 1:27:35.867
I really get under
that ice-cold skin of yours, don't I?

1:27:38.216 --> 1:27:39.336
What?

1:27:40.386 --> 1:27:43.046
Are you doubting her feelings for you?

1:27:45.724 --> 1:27:46.824
Nice.

1:27:47.960 --> 1:27:53.300
So picking through my brain's okay,
but letting me into yours, forget it.

1:27:57.303 --> 1:27:58.463
Look.

1:28:00.039 --> 1:28:02.909
- I know she's in love with you.
- Good.

1:28:03.576 --> 1:28:05.906
But she's in love with me, too.

1:28:08.147 --> 1:28:10.667
She just won't admit it to herself.

1:28:13.686 --> 1:28:16.116
I can't tell if you're right.

1:28:17.590 --> 1:28:19.110
Then let me ask you something.

1:28:20.192 --> 1:28:22.922
- If she chooses me...
- She won't.

1:28:23.495 --> 1:28:24.825
If she did,

1:28:26.565 --> 1:28:27.955
would you try to kill me?

1:28:29.603 --> 1:28:31.703
That's an intriguing idea.

1:28:36.610 --> 1:28:39.740
But, no. I couldn't hurt her like that.

1:28:40.880 --> 1:28:43.640
So you'd just turn her into
a blood-sucking demon like you?

1:28:44.451 --> 1:28:47.351
I don't want that. I never wanted that.

1:28:47.787 --> 1:28:50.307
- So stop her.
- I tried.

1:28:52.125 --> 1:28:54.855
- I left.
- But you gave up too quickly.

1:28:56.796 --> 1:29:01.696
If you'd stayed away another 6 months,
I could've made her happy.

1:29:02.469 --> 1:29:03.799
Trust me.

1:29:05.305 --> 1:29:10.135
You have to consider
that I might be better for her than you are.

1:29:12.812 --> 1:29:14.752
I have considered that.

1:29:18.452 --> 1:29:20.612
I know you can protect her.

1:29:23.257 --> 1:29:28.087
But you can give her a life, a human life.
That's all I want for her.

1:29:31.265 --> 1:29:32.315
But I'm not...

1:29:33.401 --> 1:29:36.671
I'm not going to force her into anything
ever again.

1:29:39.106 --> 1:29:42.436
The last time I tried,
it almost killed us both.

1:29:44.779 --> 1:29:47.179
Yeah. That I remember.

1:29:51.419 --> 1:29:53.679
When you thought she was gone,

1:29:56.023 --> 1:29:57.793
that you'd lost her,

1:30:00.294 --> 1:30:03.204
how did you cope?

1:30:05.199 --> 1:30:06.999
There are no words.

1:30:13.041 --> 1:30:15.481
But I wouldn't wish it on anyone, Jacob.

1:30:18.213 --> 1:30:21.743
This might sound odd,
but I'm glad you're here.

1:30:22.617 --> 1:30:23.907
Meaning,

1:30:24.953 --> 1:30:27.923
"As much as I'd love to kill you,
I'm glad she's warm."

1:30:31.059 --> 1:30:33.359
If we weren't natural enemies

1:30:33.895 --> 1:30:36.825
and you weren't trying to
steal my reason for existing,

1:30:38.200 --> 1:30:40.330
I might actually like you.

1:30:41.369 --> 1:30:42.669
Well,

1:30:44.239 --> 1:30:48.439
if you weren't planning on sucking the life
out of the girl I love,

1:30:49.344 --> 1:30:50.684
I might...

1:30:57.754 --> 1:31:00.814
No. Not even then.

1:31:09.165 --> 1:31:12.455
But she could still change her mind,
you know.

1:31:19.242 --> 1:31:20.612
Then I'd let her go.

1:31:40.763 --> 1:31:42.363
Right. Hey, Seth.

1:31:45.569 --> 1:31:48.499
- Where's Jacob? Did he already...
- Not yet.

1:31:50.374 --> 1:31:54.144
He's checking to see if the woods are clear
before he goes.

1:32:01.251 --> 1:32:04.811
I'm really sorry about last night.
That couldn't have been easy on you.

1:32:05.255 --> 1:32:08.245
It definitely won't make my list
of top 10 favorite evenings.

1:32:09.326 --> 1:32:13.456
- You have a list?
- All 10 I spent with you.

1:32:14.898 --> 1:32:19.268
Number one is when you said
you'd marry me, Mrs. Cullen.

1:32:23.106 --> 1:32:27.006
This is the 21st century.
I at least want to hyphenate my name.

1:32:27.845 --> 1:32:31.295
- You're marrying him?
- Jake, I...

1:32:35.687 --> 1:32:39.147
- You knew he was listening!
- He deserves to know.

1:32:40.525 --> 1:32:42.075
- Jake, stop!
- Bella, let him...

1:32:42.193 --> 1:32:43.323
Don't!

1:32:46.397 --> 1:32:47.457
Jake, stop!

1:32:51.135 --> 1:32:54.585
- BELLA : Jake, please!
- I'm done! I'm so done!

1:32:55.840 --> 1:32:57.070
What can I do?

1:32:57.141 --> 1:33:01.341
You can't do anything. I can,
by going out there and killing something.

1:33:01.412 --> 1:33:04.012
No! You're not thinking clearly!
Don't do that!

1:33:04.215 --> 1:33:06.875
Maybe I'll get myself killed
and make it simple for you.

1:33:06.951 --> 1:33:09.391
No! Just, Jake, stay.

1:33:11.289 --> 1:33:12.479
Why?

1:33:14.359 --> 1:33:16.049
Give me one good reason.

1:33:17.195 --> 1:33:19.125
Because I don't wanna lose you.

1:33:20.765 --> 1:33:22.125
It's not good enough.

1:33:23.535 --> 1:33:25.395
Because you're too important.

1:33:28.841 --> 1:33:32.331
- Still not good enough.
- Jacob!

1:33:36.582 --> 1:33:37.842
Kiss me.

1:33:41.220 --> 1:33:44.680
I'm asking you to kiss me.

1:34:32.472 --> 1:34:35.102
That should have been our first kiss.

1:34:40.714 --> 1:34:42.114
I gotta go.

1:34:45.051 --> 1:34:46.451
I'll be back.

1:35:16.684 --> 1:35:20.094
- You saw.
- No, but...

1:35:21.088 --> 1:35:22.848
Jacob's thoughts are pretty loud.

1:35:24.392 --> 1:35:25.922
I don't know what happened.

1:35:27.928 --> 1:35:29.358
You love him.

1:35:33.768 --> 1:35:35.568
I love you more.

1:35:37.304 --> 1:35:38.674
I know.

She's close. I can hear her thoughts.

1:38:08.492 --> 1:38:09.722
Seth, go.

1:38:14.699 --> 1:38:17.069
She knew we weren't there,
but she caught my scent.

1:38:17.535 --> 1:38:19.625
She knew you'd be with me.

1:38:20.271 --> 1:38:21.741
She found us.

1:38:25.343 --> 1:38:27.003
She's not alone.

1:38:36.154 --> 1:38:38.954
Riley, listen to me.

1:38:40.391 --> 1:38:43.451
Victoria's just using you to distract me.

1:38:44.229 --> 1:38:45.699
She knows I'll kill you.

1:38:49.367 --> 1:38:53.127
In fact, she'll be glad
she doesn't have to deal with you anymore.

1:38:53.805 --> 1:38:58.165
Don't listen, Riley.
I told you about their mind tricks.

1:38:58.243 --> 1:39:02.083
I can read her mind.
So I know what she thinks of you.

1:39:02.580 --> 1:39:04.240
VICTORIA : He's lying.

1:39:04.316 --> 1:39:08.976
She only created you and this army
to avenge her true mate, James.

1:39:10.155 --> 1:39:13.275
That's the only thing she cares about.
Not you.

1:39:15.928 --> 1:39:19.388
There's only you. You know that.

1:39:21.800 --> 1:39:25.460
Think about it. You're from Forks.

1:39:27.373 --> 1:39:28.533
You know the area.

1:39:29.642 --> 1:39:31.512
That's the only reason she chose you.

1:39:33.212 --> 1:39:35.442
She doesn't love you.

1:39:35.514 --> 1:39:40.514
Riley. Don't let him do this to us.

1:39:42.955 --> 1:39:44.415
You know I love you.

You want her.

1:40:24.698 --> 1:40:27.928
You want me to feel the pain you felt
when I killed James,

1:40:30.070 --> 1:40:32.730
when I tore him to pieces,

1:40:35.241 --> 1:40:37.941
when I turned him into ash,

Jacob. Hold on.
Carlisle's gonna take care of you.

- Jake, I'm right here.

- Jacob, you idiot, I had it!
- Leah!

1:44:23.308 --> 1:44:25.968
I need to set the bones
before his accelerated healing kicks in.

1:44:26.044 --> 1:44:28.344
- It's already starting.
- EDWARD : We need to get him out of here.

1:44:28.413 --> 1:44:31.283
We're not gonna win a fight
with the Volturi.

- We'll take him back to Billy's.
- I'll be there soon as I can.

an assault of this magnitude intact.

1:45:18.831 --> 1:45:20.391
We were lucky.

1:45:21.867 --> 1:45:23.457
I doubt that.

1:45:25.371 --> 1:45:28.831
- It appears we missed an entertaining fight.
- JANE : Yes.

1:45:29.575 --> 1:45:32.235
It's not often we're rendered unnecessary.

1:45:32.311 --> 1:45:35.111

you would have fulfilled your purpose.

in exchange for her surrender.

I know.

1:46:16.256 --> 1:46:20.116
I don't know! Riley wouldn't tell us.

1:46:21.227 --> 1:46:23.287
He said our thoughts weren't safe.

1:46:23.364 --> 1:46:26.634
Her name was Victoria.
Perhaps you knew her.

1:46:27.535 --> 1:46:30.795
DR. CULLEN : Edward,
if the Volturi had knowledge of Victoria,

1:46:30.871 --> 1:46:31.861
they would have stopped her.

1:46:33.407 --> 1:46:34.697
Isn't that right, Jane?

1:46:37.111 --> 1:46:38.601
Of course.

1:46:40.081 --> 1:46:41.141
Felix.

1:46:42.450 --> 1:46:43.880
She didn't know what she was doing.

1:46:45.820 --> 1:46:48.150
We'll take responsibility for her.

1:46:48.723 --> 1:46:50.353
Give her a chance.

1:46:53.160 --> 1:46:58.360
The Volturi don't give second chances.
Keep that in mind.

1:46:59.633 --> 1:47:02.503
Caius will be interested to know
that she's still human.

1:47:02.870 --> 1:47:04.960

1:47:07.341 --> 1:47:11.001

1:47:46.515 --> 1:47:50.005
- It's been going on for a while.
- EMBRY : Doc's re-breaking his bones.

1:47:50.085 --> 1:47:51.915
Why did he have to butt in?
I could've taken that tick.

1:47:51.987 --> 1:47:53.507
Give it a rest, Leah.

1:48:00.095 --> 1:48:01.925
The worst is over. He'll be all right.

1:48:02.965 --> 1:48:04.125
I gave him some morphine,

1:48:04.200 --> 1:48:06.530
but his body temperature
will burn it off soon.

1:48:06.602 --> 1:48:08.662
I'll come back to set up a drip.

1:48:09.205 --> 1:48:10.635
Thank you.

1:48:20.583 --> 1:48:21.783
He's asking for you.

1:48:37.099 --> 1:48:38.159
Hey, Jake.

1:48:41.737 --> 1:48:42.997
Hey.

1:48:55.886 --> 1:48:59.686
- I was worried about you.
- You were worried about me?

1:49:01.458 --> 1:49:03.048
Yeah.

1:49:04.061 --> 1:49:06.861
I guessed Edward would read my thoughts.

1:49:09.533 --> 1:49:12.993
- Was he hard on you?
- He wasn't even mad at me.

1:49:14.238 --> 1:49:15.398
Or you.

1:49:16.907 --> 1:49:18.397
Well, damn.

1:49:20.911 --> 1:49:24.871
- He's better than I thought.
- He's not playing a game.

1:49:27.417 --> 1:49:28.677
Right.

1:49:32.222 --> 1:49:33.522
Bella.

1:49:36.827 --> 1:49:39.657
He's not as perfect as you think.

1:49:43.201 --> 1:49:44.901
I know who he is.

1:49:49.240 --> 1:49:51.640
Can we just not talk about that?

1:49:52.844 --> 1:49:55.904
I'd rather get all the re-breaking done
at once.

1:50:02.020 --> 1:50:04.850
Well, at least I know
I did everything I could.

1:50:08.693 --> 1:50:12.033
It wasn't easy making you admit
your feelings for me.

1:50:15.466 --> 1:50:18.486
I only fought them because I knew
they wouldn't change anything.

1:50:26.711 --> 1:50:29.651
I'm exactly right for you, Bella.

1:50:32.151 --> 1:50:36.821
It would be as easy as breathing, with me.

1:50:42.828 --> 1:50:45.128
You know I love you.

1:50:51.904 --> 1:50:54.814
You know how much I wish it was enough.

1:51:06.685 --> 1:51:07.845
Should I come back?

1:51:11.056 --> 1:51:12.746
I need some time.

1:51:17.464 --> 1:51:19.564
But I'll always be waiting.

1:51:24.804 --> 1:51:27.604
Until my heart stops beating.

1:51:29.576 --> 1:51:30.906
Maybe even then.

1:51:54.000 --> 1:51:58.300
- August 13th?
- Yeah. It's a month before my birthday.

1:51:58.905 --> 1:52:01.995
I don't need to be
another year older than you.

1:52:02.809 --> 1:52:04.609
Alice said she could get the wedding
together by then.

1:52:05.713 --> 1:52:07.413
I'm sure she can.

1:52:09.784 --> 1:52:11.454
There's no rush.

1:52:14.021 --> 1:52:17.221
I've chosen my life. I want
to start living it.

1:52:18.192 --> 1:52:21.652
And so you're gonna let Alice
plan the whole thing?

1:52:21.996 --> 1:52:26.486
The dress, the reception, the guest list.

1:52:26.567 --> 1:52:29.367
I mean, who knows who
she's gonna invite?

1:52:31.372 --> 1:52:32.932
Does it matter?

1:52:37.545 --> 1:52:39.475
I just don't know why
you're doing this.

1:52:39.547 --> 1:52:42.737
- What? The wedding?
- No.

1:52:45.719 --> 1:52:48.549
You're trying to make
everyone else happy,

1:52:49.490 --> 1:52:52.050
but you're already giving
away too much.

1:52:52.993 --> 1:52:54.483
You're wrong.

1:53:02.504 --> 1:53:05.874
This wasn't a choice
between you and Jacob.

1:53:09.711 --> 1:53:13.811
It was between who I should be
and who I am.

1:53:17.519 --> 1:53:22.509
I've always felt out of step,
like literally stumbling through my life.

1:53:25.694 --> 1:53:27.594
I've never felt normal.

1:53:30.132 --> 1:53:32.072
Because I'm not normal.

1:53:33.301 --> 1:53:34.961
I don't want to be.

1:53:36.471 --> 1:53:41.701
I've had to face death
and loss and pain

1:53:43.079 --> 1:53:46.239
in your world,
but I've also never felt stronger

1:53:48.918 --> 1:53:52.248
and more real, more myself.

1:53:54.991 --> 1:53:57.151
Because it's my world, too.

1:54:00.396 --> 1:54:02.156
It's where I belong.

1:54:09.005 --> 1:54:11.165
So it's not just about me?

1:54:13.409 --> 1:54:16.439
No. Sorry.

1:54:18.814 --> 1:54:23.884
I've made a mess trying to figure
all this out, but I wanna do it right.

1:54:25.254 --> 1:54:29.664
And I wanna tie myself to you
in every way humanly possible.

1:54:33.997 --> 1:54:35.557
Starting with a wedding.

1:54:39.836 --> 1:54:41.236
Actually,

1:54:42.139 --> 1:54:47.099
something a little more difficult first.
And maybe even dangerous.

1:54:52.849 --> 1:54:54.279
We have to tell Charlie.

1:54:58.455 --> 1:54:59.715
It's highly dangerous.

1:55:00.791 --> 1:55:02.951
It's a good thing you're bulletproof.

1:55:05.028 --> 1:55:06.548
I'm gonna need that ring.
