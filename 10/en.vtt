WEBVTT

00:54.030 --> 00:55.493
Do you believe in God?

00:56.850 --> 00:58.230
Fuck you.

00:58.230 --> 00:59.063
No, for real.

00:59.063 --> 01:00.000
I'm completely serious.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.100
Yeah, as am I. Fuck you.

01:02.100 --> 01:05.430
Come on. It's
been three fucking days.

01:05.430 --> 01:06.930
I need some entertainment.

01:06.930 --> 01:08.610
Okay, well, why
don't you do your usual

01:08.610 --> 01:12.000
and blather on about
gorgeous babes in hot tubs

01:12.000 --> 01:13.967
with their tits out and all that shit?

01:13.967 --> 01:15.813
Oh, yeah, right.

01:16.665 --> 01:17.940
'Cause that's the very thing I want to do

01:17.940 --> 01:19.590
while lying next to you;

01:19.590 --> 01:21.665
envision nude women to
the point of arousal.

01:21.665 --> 01:23.190
God, I knew you
were gonna make it weird.

01:23.190 --> 01:24.840
You always have to make it weird.

01:24.840 --> 01:25.800
I didn't make it weird.

01:25.800 --> 01:27.060
I'm just noting the weirdness

01:27.060 --> 01:28.140
in your suggestion, that's all.

01:28.140 --> 01:28.973
Okay, fine.

01:28.973 --> 01:31.890
Let's talk about, I don't
know, baseball or something.

01:31.890 --> 01:34.770
Oh, baseball's boring as fuck.

01:34.770 --> 01:36.390
What?

01:36.390 --> 01:38.517
I'm gonna have to pretend
you did not say that.

01:38.517 --> 01:41.070
The only thing
more boring about baseball

01:41.070 --> 01:42.843
is guys talking about baseball.

01:43.680 --> 01:45.840
How are we even friends?

01:45.840 --> 01:47.250
Ah, random bunk mates.

01:47.250 --> 01:48.609
Luck of the draw.

01:48.609 --> 01:50.487
Yeah, well, I
don't believe in luck.

01:50.487 --> 01:52.203
But you do believe in God?

01:53.070 --> 01:54.560
Jesus Christ...

01:55.548 --> 01:57.290
Why can't we talk about this, huh?

01:57.290 --> 01:59.190
Do you believe in God?

01:59.190 --> 02:00.120
I don't know.

02:00.120 --> 02:00.953
That's why I'm asking.

02:00.953 --> 02:03.846
I'm just wondering about it all, I guess.

02:03.846 --> 02:05.367
All right. Okay.

02:05.367 --> 02:06.630
And when did this happen?

02:06.630 --> 02:08.160
Was it when you were up to your chin

02:08.160 --> 02:11.280
in tits and asses in some
whorehouse or something?

02:11.280 --> 02:12.480
Oh, yeah, baby.

02:12.480 --> 02:14.400
That'll be Bangkok.

02:14.400 --> 02:15.233
So what?

02:15.233 --> 02:17.430
You just don't think about this shit?

02:17.430 --> 02:18.810
What? God and shit.

02:18.810 --> 02:19.643
No.

02:21.270 --> 02:23.543
Why are you interested
in this all of a sudden?

02:24.630 --> 02:27.270
It's natural to
wonder about the job.

02:27.270 --> 02:28.530
I know you don't.

02:28.530 --> 02:30.540
No. You want to know why?

02:30.540 --> 02:31.373
Because it's...

02:31.373 --> 02:33.150
Counterproductive.

02:33.150 --> 02:33.983
You're an...

02:33.983 --> 02:34.816
asshole.

02:34.816 --> 02:35.649
Of course I am.

02:40.290 --> 02:43.893
So, uh what do you think
happens after we die?

02:44.730 --> 02:45.960
Nothing happens.

02:45.960 --> 02:47.460
Nothing?

02:47.460 --> 02:51.063
No. You're alive, then you're dead.

02:52.080 --> 02:52.920
That's it.

02:52.920 --> 02:55.080
So you believe in nothing?

02:55.080 --> 02:56.700
No, that's not what I said.

02:56.700 --> 02:59.225
I'm pretty sure that's
exactly what you just said.

02:59.225 --> 03:00.300
No, no, no. I didn't say that.

03:00.300 --> 03:03.990
What I said was nothing
happens after we die.

03:03.990 --> 03:06.090
Ah, so, what is it?

03:06.090 --> 03:08.010
You do or you don't believe?

03:08.010 --> 03:08.970
Pick one.

03:08.970 --> 03:10.440
Remember what our instructor said

03:10.440 --> 03:12.150
when somebody hands you a weapon

03:12.150 --> 03:14.190
and claims it's not loaded?

03:14.190 --> 03:16.710
Ah, verify then trust?

03:16.710 --> 03:17.850
There you go.

03:17.850 --> 03:19.233
That's my take on God.

03:20.190 --> 03:22.614
Still waiting for verification.

03:22.614 --> 03:24.160
Yeah. I hear that.

03:24.160 --> 03:25.983
But I do wonder sometimes.

03:27.990 --> 03:30.393
Oh, hello, we've got movement.

03:31.860 --> 03:33.903
Okay, black SUV.

03:35.670 --> 03:37.563
I see you, motherfucker.

03:39.180 --> 03:40.710
You sure this is our guy?

03:40.710 --> 03:41.760
The picture looks different,

03:41.760 --> 03:43.353
like he's lost a lotta weight.

03:44.460 --> 03:46.743
Yeah, it's him. Positive.

03:50.130 --> 03:51.580
I think you might be right.

03:52.740 --> 03:53.703
Showtime.

03:54.690 --> 03:56.493
Those are fucking mercs.

03:57.360 --> 03:59.360
This prick brought his own private army.

04:01.200 --> 04:02.400
How's it look?

04:02.400 --> 04:03.960
We've got a lot of eyes on this.

04:03.960 --> 04:06.332
But, yeah, it's doable.

04:14.767 --> 04:18.630
Oh, hello.

04:18.630 --> 04:20.013
Woo hoo!

04:21.420 --> 04:23.850
Oh, shit. Oh, my God.

04:23.850 --> 04:25.250
That must be his newest toy.

04:32.231 --> 04:34.064
You think she's a pro?

04:35.100 --> 04:36.330
I'm sure she's just with him

04:36.330 --> 04:40.320
because of his winning
personality, don't you?

04:40.320 --> 04:41.520
How much do you think she costs?

04:41.520 --> 04:43.110
More than we make.

04:43.110 --> 04:44.310
Well, that's not hard.

04:47.430 --> 04:49.053
Slight northwest breeze.

04:50.190 --> 04:51.273
three miles per.

04:52.260 --> 04:54.750
Ah, 2.6 clicks.

04:54.750 --> 04:57.183
Copy that. Zoning in.

05:03.226 --> 05:04.440
Come on, Sam.

05:04.440 --> 05:06.004
This might be our only chance.

05:06.004 --> 05:07.724
Our only chance.

05:19.585 --> 05:20.668
Fuck! Shit!

05:22.320 --> 05:23.580
Fucking killed her!

05:23.580 --> 05:24.413
No, you didn't.

05:24.413 --> 05:25.560
I still see her breathing.

05:25.560 --> 05:27.227
You still have a shot. Focus.

05:28.174 --> 05:29.683
Look... You see that?

05:29.683 --> 05:30.516
He's not leaving her.

05:30.516 --> 05:31.349
She's not just a fucking hooker.

05:31.349 --> 05:32.760
Focus on the job at hand.

05:32.760 --> 05:33.723
Focus.

05:38.598 --> 05:40.673
Shots fired!

05:40.673 --> 05:45.115
Breathe. Take the shot, Sam!

05:45.115 --> 05:46.115
Kill them!

05:48.480 --> 05:49.624
Goddamn it, you have to take the-

05:51.819 --> 05:54.450
Shots fired. Man down.

05:54.450 --> 05:57.090
Bingo. That's a confirmed kill.

05:57.090 --> 05:57.923
You see that?

05:57.923 --> 05:59.400
She looked right at me.

05:59.400 --> 06:00.921
Fine, fine.

06:00.921 --> 06:02.273
But tell me about it later, yeah?

06:06.713 --> 06:08.795
Hey! Don't move!

06:08.795 --> 06:12.104
Oh, fuck.

06:20.280 --> 06:21.113
Go, go, go!

06:27.187 --> 06:28.320
Oh, shit.

06:28.320 --> 06:29.820
We're fucked. We're fucked.

06:29.820 --> 06:31.800
Alright, remember Beirut?

06:31.800 --> 06:32.633
We can do it again.

06:32.633 --> 06:33.540
We just need to find some sheets.

06:33.540 --> 06:34.740
There's no sheets up here, bro.

06:34.740 --> 06:36.043
And Beirut didn't work.

06:36.043 --> 06:36.876
It would have if it was silk sheets.

06:36.876 --> 06:38.100
Look, I broke my ankle.

06:38.100 --> 06:39.030
This is twice as high.

06:39.030 --> 06:40.731
Bullshit. Find another way.

06:40.731 --> 06:41.564
Oh, okay. Okay.

06:41.564 --> 06:42.813
We'll take the hard way.

06:54.446 --> 06:56.005
Hey, on me.

07:03.386 --> 07:05.089
Hey, hey, hey. Back, back.

07:05.089 --> 07:05.922
Against the wall.

07:05.922 --> 07:07.087
Against the wall. Move.

07:07.087 --> 07:08.420
Shh, shh. Quiet.

07:11.040 --> 07:12.766
Sam. Contact.

07:12.766 --> 07:13.918
Come on.

07:13.918 --> 07:14.835
Drop 'em.

07:21.702 --> 07:23.460
I'm sorry. Sorry.

07:23.460 --> 07:24.293
Go!

07:48.009 --> 07:48.842
Hands up!

07:48.842 --> 07:49.890
Take it easy.

07:49.890 --> 07:50.973
Hold on ladies.

07:53.970 --> 07:54.803
We give up.

07:58.860 --> 08:00.270
Any thoughts?

08:00.270 --> 08:01.420
Besides we're fucked?

08:03.030 --> 08:04.193
Slow. Slow.

08:35.220 --> 08:38.053
Hey, what took so long? Come on.

08:44.070 --> 08:45.457
What the hell are we doing up here, Ken?

08:45.457 --> 08:46.358
Where are you taking us?

08:46.358 --> 08:49.191
Just trust me on this one, okay?

08:52.139 --> 08:53.358
Oh, no. No.

08:53.358 --> 08:56.525
Hey, hey, call this a leap of faith.

09:18.142 --> 09:23.142
I told you
Beirut would have worked.

09:27.300 --> 09:28.133
Ah.

09:35.647 --> 09:38.400
It was a good kill, Sam.

09:38.400 --> 09:41.070
That woman, she was breathing.

09:41.070 --> 09:41.903
I saw it.

09:42.870 --> 09:43.890
And even if she wasn't,

09:43.890 --> 09:46.830
she was lip locking with
an arms dealing terrorist.

09:46.830 --> 09:49.170
The guy was a shit-bird deluxe.

09:49.170 --> 09:50.003
Yeah?

09:50.003 --> 09:52.020
Then why would she throw
herself in front of a bullet

09:52.020 --> 09:53.133
to save the man, Ken?

09:54.660 --> 09:55.760
Why would she do that?

09:57.510 --> 09:59.190
Maybe she didn't.

09:59.190 --> 10:00.300
Maybe she slipped.

10:00.300 --> 10:01.680
She didn't slip, okay.

10:01.680 --> 10:03.210
She was looking right at me.

10:03.210 --> 10:05.040
She saw what I was
about to do, and then...

10:05.040 --> 10:07.140
She wouldn't know what she was looking at.

10:07.140 --> 10:10.440
She's a hooker, a high priced one but-

10:10.440 --> 10:12.540
Look, she threw herself
in front of a bullet

10:12.540 --> 10:14.310
to protect him.

10:14.310 --> 10:16.380
Now, if he was such a terrible person,

10:16.380 --> 10:17.490
why would she do that?

10:17.490 --> 10:20.190
It doesn't matter. It was a good kill.

10:20.190 --> 10:21.750
That's what we do.
- Yeah, good kill.

10:21.750 --> 10:23.370
I heard you the first time.

10:23.370 --> 10:24.573
So you keep saying.

10:25.530 --> 10:28.680
Look, if he was a
solid, upstanding citizen,

10:28.680 --> 10:31.320
he would have never been a
target in the first place.

10:31.320 --> 10:32.880
If she didn't want to catch a bullet,

10:32.880 --> 10:35.400
she shouldn't have been
in fucking bed with him.

10:35.400 --> 10:36.600
He's dirty.

10:36.600 --> 10:38.340
That makes her dirty.

10:38.340 --> 10:39.840
It's simple math, brother.

10:39.840 --> 10:41.193
Simple fucking math.

10:49.539 --> 10:53.493
Tam.

10:54.360 --> 10:55.818
You deal with it.

10:55.818 --> 10:56.651
Ah!

11:00.930 --> 11:02.160
Yeah?

11:02.160 --> 11:02.993
Mm.

11:07.170 --> 11:09.723
Hey, Sam. I heard it was rough.

11:10.650 --> 11:11.483
Yeah.

11:12.469 --> 11:13.680
Are you okay?

11:13.680 --> 11:15.930
Oh, I'm, yeah. Great.

11:15.930 --> 11:18.120
It's collateral damage, Sam.

11:18.120 --> 11:20.520
Listen, if you need to talk to someone-

11:20.520 --> 11:24.060
I don't need a fucking
shrink, Tam, okay?

11:24.060 --> 11:26.310
Jesus Christ.

11:26.310 --> 11:27.723
Okay, I understand.

11:28.590 --> 11:32.433
I'm here, but trust me,
we are righteous on this.

11:33.741 --> 11:34.950
You think so?

11:34.950 --> 11:37.320
On my life,
I would not have put you

11:37.320 --> 11:39.240
in a situation like that if it weren't.

11:39.240 --> 11:43.350
Well uh, doesn't make
it any easier, does it?

11:43.350 --> 11:45.423
Tell her I go down easy.

11:45.423 --> 11:46.256
So easy.

11:47.661 --> 11:49.578
Sam, listen,

11:51.810 --> 11:53.640
take some time off.

11:53.640 --> 11:55.190
There's nothing on the horizon.

11:56.580 --> 11:59.253
Look, I'll contact you
when I resurface, okay?

12:00.750 --> 12:01.583
Fuck.

12:10.080 --> 12:11.640
What?

12:11.640 --> 12:12.573
You're a dick!

12:15.120 --> 12:15.953
And?

12:27.030 --> 12:30.450
You wanna grab a bite to eat and a beer?

12:30.450 --> 12:31.533
Nah, man. I'm good.

12:33.360 --> 12:34.920
I was just fucking around

12:34.920 --> 12:36.352
with all the God talk, you know?

12:36.352 --> 12:37.470
It's got nothing to
do with the God talk.

12:37.470 --> 12:38.303
All right, Ken?

12:38.303 --> 12:39.960
Hey, hey, okay.

12:39.960 --> 12:40.793
Alright.

12:42.090 --> 12:44.913
Why don't you, uh, come to Amsterdam?

12:45.780 --> 12:47.580
We'll get high, get laid.

12:47.580 --> 12:49.320
Lather, rinse, repeat.

12:49.320 --> 12:51.150
You mean like high school?

12:51.150 --> 12:52.590
Oh, yeah. What's wrong with that?

12:52.590 --> 12:55.110
Nothing, if you're still in high school.

12:55.110 --> 12:56.520
Oh, so if I understand
what you're saying

12:56.520 --> 12:59.370
is that I'm a asshole refusing
to grow up, is that it?

12:59.370 --> 13:01.500
Would have thought
that was obvious. Right?

13:01.500 --> 13:03.030
Why don't you go fuck
yourself in the ass?

13:03.030 --> 13:04.710
You see? Very adult of you.

13:04.710 --> 13:05.543
Well done.

13:07.110 --> 13:08.550
Hey, it went cockeyed.

13:08.550 --> 13:09.630
It's not the first time.

13:09.630 --> 13:10.800
You know that.

13:10.800 --> 13:12.210
Chick fell in front of your shot.

13:12.210 --> 13:13.950
Shit happens. It's bad luck.

13:13.950 --> 13:15.270
I don't believe in luck.

16:52.410 --> 16:53.610
Happy hunting, friend.

17:05.307 --> 17:06.423
Ah, Christ.

17:22.170 --> 17:23.103
Hey, Tam.

17:25.704 --> 17:27.363
I'm good. What's up?

17:30.180 --> 17:33.333
Oh, you know, just ah, hanging out.

17:35.007 --> 17:36.340
What's going on?

17:38.443 --> 17:39.667
Uh-huh.

17:53.640 --> 17:56.280
Look who decided to fucking surface.

17:56.280 --> 17:57.600
What the fuck, bro?

17:57.600 --> 17:58.770
How many emails and texts

17:58.770 --> 18:00.220
are you gonna ignore from me?

18:01.141 --> 18:01.974
You know, your girlfriend was almost

18:01.974 --> 18:03.282
losing her fucking mind 'cause you're-

18:03.282 --> 18:04.230
She's not my girlfriend.

18:04.230 --> 18:06.330
Tam wasn't even sure
you was gonna show up.

18:06.330 --> 18:07.710
I said "If he agrees to a job,

18:07.710 --> 18:08.610
his ass would be here."

18:08.610 --> 18:11.280
Oh, you see, you had faith. I like that.

18:11.280 --> 18:12.113
- Oh, yeah?
- That's nice.

18:12.113 --> 18:14.040
I got two words for you: blow me.

18:14.040 --> 18:15.000
Oh, elegant.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.230
Get in the fucking car.

18:16.230 --> 18:17.340
Fuck you.

18:17.340 --> 18:18.750
- Oh, fuck you.
- Oh, fuck you!

18:18.750 --> 18:19.583
Fuck you!

18:32.340 --> 18:34.664
Ah, Frankfurt.

18:34.664 --> 18:36.390
How I've missed you.

18:36.390 --> 18:37.653
So, how was Amsterdam?

18:39.390 --> 18:41.580
New low in terms of sexual excess.

18:41.580 --> 18:42.413
I bet.

18:43.680 --> 18:45.450
I'm so ashamed.

18:45.450 --> 18:46.413
And very hung over.

18:48.746 --> 18:49.980
Did Tam say anything else?

18:49.980 --> 18:51.180
What, about the job?

18:51.180 --> 18:54.183
No. About, about me?

18:56.250 --> 18:57.930
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

18:57.930 --> 19:00.900
She said, "Don't forget
to pack your binoculars

19:00.900 --> 19:02.577
so you can see your tiny cock."

19:04.770 --> 19:07.320
No, nothing. Why?

19:07.320 --> 19:08.640
I'm out after this, brother.

19:08.640 --> 19:10.260
I spoke to Tam this morning.

19:10.260 --> 19:11.665
This is it.

19:11.665 --> 19:12.750
After this, I'm done.

19:12.750 --> 19:13.680
Bullshit.

19:13.680 --> 19:15.000
No, I'm not joking.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.523
Ken, I'm serious.

19:19.329 --> 19:20.463
This is it.

19:20.463 --> 19:21.333
It's time.

19:23.849 --> 19:26.250
I'm sorry, bro but, I'm done.

19:31.920 --> 19:34.170
This place looks pretty nice, right?

19:34.170 --> 19:36.003
Less depressing than usual, anyway.

19:37.140 --> 19:38.163
A step up, in fact.

19:39.000 --> 19:40.833
Welcome, gentlemen. Please.

19:44.760 --> 19:46.290
For you.

19:46.290 --> 19:47.123
No, thanks.

19:47.123 --> 19:48.203
No problem.

19:50.400 --> 19:52.080
Take your bags, please.

19:52.080 --> 19:53.160
Yeah. We good?

19:56.940 --> 19:58.920
Okay. Silent treatment.

19:58.920 --> 19:59.753
Okay.

19:59.753 --> 20:00.963
Please. Please come.

20:05.760 --> 20:06.593
Prick.

20:08.190 --> 20:09.023
Maybe.

20:11.910 --> 20:12.743
Asshole!

20:13.800 --> 20:14.633
Yeah.

20:18.580 --> 20:20.233
Donkey.

20:20.233 --> 20:22.560
Now, that's unfair.

20:22.560 --> 20:24.330
Only to fucking donkeys.

20:24.330 --> 20:25.920
Oh, only to fucking donkeys.

20:25.920 --> 20:28.080
Well, you know what, donkeys
do have to fuck, don't they?

20:28.080 --> 20:29.820
I mean, that's how we
get more donkeys, right?

20:29.820 --> 20:31.470
That's not how you get
more assholes, though.

20:31.470 --> 20:33.540
And you're a fucking asshole.

20:33.540 --> 20:36.000
And assholes breed like fungus.

20:36.000 --> 20:39.003
Ah, I think the term
you're looking for is fungi.

20:40.260 --> 20:42.873
Yeah. You were a fun guy, once.

20:44.340 --> 20:45.243
Pimple dick.

20:46.260 --> 20:47.093
Ouch!

20:48.900 --> 20:49.860
Nice segue though.

20:49.860 --> 20:51.561
Yeah, it was good.

20:51.561 --> 20:52.470
- Yeah.
- And I'm so fucking steamed,

20:52.470 --> 20:53.802
I can't enjoy it.

20:58.590 --> 20:59.433
Whoa.

21:01.650 --> 21:03.723
Uh, you sure this is our room?

21:05.716 --> 21:07.143
Yes, yes. For you.

21:08.280 --> 21:10.073
Yeah? What the hell?

21:17.040 --> 21:18.090
You sure? Right?

21:18.090 --> 21:18.923
This is our room?

21:18.923 --> 21:19.890
Yes, yes for you, sir.

21:19.890 --> 21:20.723
Yeah?

21:23.700 --> 21:25.620
Hey, Ken, check it out, bro.

21:25.620 --> 21:27.693
Your favourite, silk sheets.

21:28.741 --> 21:30.360
Have to make sure you
don't shit the bed again.

21:30.360 --> 21:31.800
I shit the bed once.

21:31.800 --> 21:33.363
One fucking time!

21:34.928 --> 21:36.180
For you, sir.

21:36.180 --> 21:37.013
Thank you.

21:42.540 --> 21:43.980
Yeah, it's from Tam.

21:43.980 --> 21:45.780
She's upgraded us.

21:45.780 --> 21:48.810
Seeing as it's our last run
together, it's a present.

21:48.810 --> 21:49.860
Yay for us.

21:49.860 --> 21:51.093
I'm good. Thanks.

21:54.330 --> 21:56.370
Hey, would you mind closing
the curtains, please?

21:56.370 --> 21:58.140
But, this beautiful sunset.

21:58.140 --> 21:59.250
Will be night soon-

21:59.250 --> 22:00.150
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's great.

22:00.150 --> 22:01.650
But please, just close the curtains.

22:01.650 --> 22:02.483
Thanks.

22:05.340 --> 22:06.183
Appreciate it.

22:09.600 --> 22:11.310
Yeah, we'll, figure out the rest.

22:11.310 --> 22:12.143
Thanks.

22:13.860 --> 22:15.240
As you wish.

22:15.240 --> 22:17.250
Um, I'm Mirko.

22:17.250 --> 22:21.393
And if you need anything,
anything, just call.

22:23.250 --> 22:24.083
Thank you.

22:32.554 --> 22:35.520
Hey, we haven't stayed here before, right?

22:35.520 --> 22:37.333
No, I'd remember it.

22:38.456 --> 22:40.320
It just feels familiar.

22:40.320 --> 22:41.153
Deja vu.

22:44.010 --> 22:46.910
I said deja vu in case you
missed it the first time, cock.

22:48.750 --> 22:50.490
All right. Come on.

22:50.490 --> 22:53.283
Let's have it. Give it to me.

22:55.200 --> 22:57.060
You're leaving and I'm fucked.

22:57.060 --> 22:58.110
What are you talking about?

22:58.110 --> 22:59.970
I'm a spotter. They don't need me.

22:59.970 --> 23:01.260
Bullshit. You can shoot.

23:01.260 --> 23:02.093
Not like you.

23:02.093 --> 23:04.470
You don't know how rare
your ability is, do you?

23:04.470 --> 23:06.180
I've only lasted this long in the company

23:06.180 --> 23:07.530
'cause I partner well with you.

23:07.530 --> 23:08.520
You!

23:08.520 --> 23:10.230
Why do you think Tam flirts
with you all the time?

23:10.230 --> 23:11.730
You're the best fucking shooter we got.

23:11.730 --> 23:12.633
And everybody knows that.

23:12.633 --> 23:14.130
Ken, you're selling yourself short.

23:14.130 --> 23:15.270
I'm just being honest.

23:15.270 --> 23:18.060
I can think on my feet,
get out of tight spots,

23:18.060 --> 23:19.140
I'm a smooth operator.

23:19.140 --> 23:20.120
I'm a way better fuck.
- There he is.

23:20.120 --> 23:23.013
But I ain't you! Nobody is.

23:25.243 --> 23:26.443
It was a good kill, Sam.

23:27.540 --> 23:30.810
It was legal, sanctioned and just.

23:30.810 --> 23:33.251
Why can't you just fucking get that?

23:33.251 --> 23:34.890
Because hat woman
sacrificed herself, Ken.

23:34.890 --> 23:35.723
Okay? She sacrificed herself.

23:35.723 --> 23:37.230
Who gives a fuck?

23:37.230 --> 23:38.370
Would you do that for someone?

23:38.370 --> 23:39.390
For that motherfucker?

23:39.390 --> 23:40.470
No, I mean for anyone.

23:40.470 --> 23:41.303
Of course I would.

23:41.303 --> 23:42.930
- Who?
- You! You fucking ass-clown.

23:42.930 --> 23:44.490
Exactly my point.

23:44.490 --> 23:47.220
And that is why I gotta
leave, bro, because,

23:47.220 --> 23:48.270
I'm a risk to you now.
- What are you-

23:48.270 --> 23:49.560
You understand that, I'm a risk to you.

23:49.560 --> 23:50.970
The day that I shot that woman,

23:50.970 --> 23:52.230
something changed in me, okay?

23:52.230 --> 23:53.493
Everything changed.

23:55.080 --> 23:56.433
I'm a different person now.

23:59.119 --> 24:01.770
You know, I just feel like I've
been staring through a scope

24:01.770 --> 24:02.940
my whole fucking life.

24:02.940 --> 24:05.130
And now I want to see what
it's like without it, you know?

24:05.130 --> 24:06.330
So I'm sorry, bro.

24:06.330 --> 24:07.683
Really, I am.

24:08.520 --> 24:11.010
And I get why you feel
like that, but I'm done.

24:11.010 --> 24:13.443
Okay? That's it, I'm out.

24:15.300 --> 24:16.133
I'm sorry.

24:22.020 --> 24:25.203
Ah, fuck!

24:29.040 --> 24:30.190
How did Tamara take it?

24:32.430 --> 24:33.980
Yeah, well, she wasn't happy.

24:35.040 --> 24:37.800
But, you know, she
wasn't surprised either.

24:37.800 --> 24:38.910
Wow.

24:38.910 --> 24:42.480
I thought she'd throw an
epic shit fit, to be honest.

24:42.480 --> 24:43.680
Yeah, well, to be honest,

24:43.680 --> 24:46.080
she said the same thing about you.

24:46.080 --> 24:49.320
Yeah, well, I do love a hissy fit.

24:49.320 --> 24:50.700
Yeah, you do.

24:50.700 --> 24:51.533
Yeah, you do.

24:54.629 --> 24:57.090
Look, I'm sorry, Ken, really, I am.

24:57.090 --> 25:01.293
But, (sighs) just feels like it's time.

25:03.780 --> 25:05.973
So uh, this is it, then?

25:07.290 --> 25:08.123
This is it.

25:09.270 --> 25:10.670
One last dance to square us.

25:11.790 --> 25:15.789
Hell. Nothing lasts forever, right?

25:17.100 --> 25:20.793
We got a penthouse, champagne.

25:21.630 --> 25:23.670
We got a city that loves the night.

25:23.670 --> 25:26.580
We got, what, 2 days
before we have to be out

25:26.580 --> 25:28.530
in the boonies?

25:28.530 --> 25:29.957
Yeah.

25:29.957 --> 25:31.943
We might as well enjoy ourselves, right?

25:32.821 --> 25:35.853
You know what? You, are a good friend.

25:36.690 --> 25:37.523
Uh, yeah.

25:37.523 --> 25:38.864
It's about time you noticed.

25:38.864 --> 25:40.470
Humble, too.

25:40.470 --> 25:43.290
Hmm. I also have a humongous-

25:43.290 --> 25:44.520
Ego?

25:44.520 --> 25:46.200
Oh is, is that what we're gonna do now?

25:46.200 --> 25:47.880
We're gonna finish each other's sentence?

25:47.880 --> 25:48.720
Well, I'm gonna have to, right,

25:48.720 --> 25:50.563
because otherwise you're not
gonna stop talking about-

25:53.396 --> 25:54.229
You need one of those cards

25:54.229 --> 25:56.700
to get the elevator to this floor, right?

25:56.700 --> 25:57.533
Yeah.

26:03.150 --> 26:04.000
Oh, shit!

26:05.160 --> 26:07.821
God. Uh-

26:07.821 --> 26:08.820
Hi.

26:08.820 --> 26:09.653
Hello.

26:09.653 --> 26:11.910
We're here for your massages.

26:11.910 --> 26:14.163
A gift from management and your boss.

26:15.238 --> 26:16.071
They know the word of the day?

26:16.071 --> 26:19.080
Uh yeah. Do you, do you
know the word of the day?

26:19.080 --> 26:21.600
Haber, haberdashery?

26:21.600 --> 26:22.803
Haberdashery.

26:23.820 --> 26:25.260
That is the word of the day.

26:25.260 --> 26:26.093
It is.

26:26.093 --> 26:27.450
You're good, then?

26:27.450 --> 26:29.508
Uh yeah. Yeah, we're good.

26:29.508 --> 26:30.930
We're all good, too.

26:30.930 --> 26:32.310
Come on up.

26:32.310 --> 26:33.480
Wait. I do-

26:33.480 --> 26:34.620
Two hot chicks.

26:34.620 --> 26:36.706
Don't fuck this up for me. Shh.

26:38.073 --> 26:38.906
Bro. Bro.

26:38.906 --> 26:40.917
Whoo! Now I believe in God.

26:42.944 --> 26:44.973
Oh yeah.

26:47.181 --> 26:52.181
Ah, first class all the way right, ace?

26:53.250 --> 26:55.350
You're gonna miss this, man.

26:55.350 --> 26:57.750
Tell me you're not gonna miss this.

26:57.750 --> 26:59.430
I'm not gonna miss this.

26:59.430 --> 27:01.323
You're a lying sack of shit.

27:04.290 --> 27:05.640
Hey. Uh sorry.

27:05.640 --> 27:07.350
Uh, what's your name?

27:07.350 --> 27:09.990
Her name is Mona. I am Lily.

27:09.990 --> 27:13.050
Mona, you mind closing
the drapes, please?

27:13.050 --> 27:15.210
What's the difference? It's night.

27:15.210 --> 27:17.070
Yeah, it gives me an
edge having it open, okay?

27:17.070 --> 27:19.320
Just please close the drapes.

27:19.320 --> 27:20.880
Whatever relaxes you.

27:20.880 --> 27:21.713
Thank you.

27:28.680 --> 27:29.513
Ready?

27:31.290 --> 27:33.924
You know what? I'm
not sure I'm up for it.

27:33.924 --> 27:34.871
I'm not really into it.

27:34.871 --> 27:38.160
Wha, what'd
I tell you about him?

27:38.160 --> 27:39.210
What did I say?

27:39.210 --> 27:41.580
His tight ass can't even
enjoy a rub and tug.

27:41.580 --> 27:43.710
Who said anything about
rubbing and tugging?

27:43.710 --> 27:45.160
You don't want to lay down?

27:46.260 --> 27:47.093
Come, sit.

27:49.350 --> 27:50.493
Over here. Come.

27:54.520 --> 27:55.353
Okay.

27:57.570 --> 27:58.403
Okay.

28:09.420 --> 28:10.920
Wha, what is this?

28:12.720 --> 28:14.510
What are we doing here?

28:14.510 --> 28:16.382
Adjusting your chakra.

28:16.382 --> 28:18.300
Oh, adjusting my chakra.

28:18.300 --> 28:21.840
Oh, she's got hidden talents.

28:21.840 --> 28:24.450
What else can the lovely Mona do, huh?

28:24.450 --> 28:26.460
I can tell you your future.

28:26.460 --> 28:27.720
Oh, you can?

28:27.720 --> 28:29.503
You hear that, sport?
She's a fortune teller!

28:29.503 --> 28:31.635
Yeah, sure she is.

28:31.635 --> 28:34.470
You're wasting
your time with him, doll.

28:34.470 --> 28:36.660
He's a spiritual black hole.

28:36.660 --> 28:40.593
Well, my mother used to
say everyone has a spirit,

28:41.430 --> 28:43.263
whether they believe in it or not.

28:44.910 --> 28:46.323
She was a real gypsy.

28:47.820 --> 28:49.680
Used to read palms.

28:49.680 --> 28:50.670
I learned from her.

28:50.670 --> 28:53.263
Oh, not any fortune teller.

28:53.263 --> 28:55.050
A gypsy fortune teller.

28:55.050 --> 28:56.250
Next thing I know, you'll be telling me

28:56.250 --> 28:57.600
you got a crystal ball.

28:57.600 --> 28:59.149
Of course.

28:59.149 --> 29:00.240
What? Really?

29:00.240 --> 29:02.400
Get the fuck outta here.

29:02.400 --> 29:03.270
For real?

29:03.270 --> 29:05.160
It was a gift from my mother.

29:05.160 --> 29:07.020
I carry it with me all the time.

29:07.020 --> 29:08.463
- Yeah?
- For luck.

29:09.740 --> 29:13.050
I will tip you a solid $100

29:13.050 --> 29:14.700
if you show me your crystal ball.

29:17.370 --> 29:18.203
Okay.

29:19.620 --> 29:22.470
She's literally going
to get the ball right now.

29:22.470 --> 29:25.413
Apparently. Yeah.

29:29.427 --> 29:32.160
Oh, shit.

29:32.160 --> 29:35.043
That's some Harry Potter wizard shit!

29:37.200 --> 29:39.360
Hold on, wait, wait, wait. Come on.

29:39.360 --> 29:40.860
I want to see you use it.

29:40.860 --> 29:42.360
I've never had anyone see my future

29:42.360 --> 29:44.010
in a crystal ball before.

29:44.010 --> 29:44.910
Well, I must confess,

29:44.910 --> 29:47.310
the ball is just a prop for tourists.

29:47.310 --> 29:50.220
Ah, you see. Finally, some honesty.

29:50.220 --> 29:53.013
But the palms are for real.

29:54.210 --> 29:57.210
I swear on my life, the palms never lie.

29:57.210 --> 29:59.643
All right. Say no more.

30:00.900 --> 30:01.743
What's it say?

30:04.020 --> 30:05.770
This is gonna be good.

30:08.010 --> 30:10.200
You don't like to stay in one place

30:10.200 --> 30:12.033
and you don't wish to grow old.

30:12.990 --> 30:15.210
You want to be a bad boy your whole life.

30:15.210 --> 30:16.043
Oh, yeah.

30:16.043 --> 30:18.270
And ladies, they love you for it.

30:18.270 --> 30:21.600
Yes, I see much physical
exertion in his future.

30:21.600 --> 30:22.433
Hey, did you hear that?

30:22.433 --> 30:23.820
She's got your number, pal.

30:23.820 --> 30:26.163
I like her. She's fun.

30:27.630 --> 30:29.080
What about my boy over there?

30:30.540 --> 30:31.503
What does his say?

30:32.760 --> 30:33.593
Okay.

30:35.970 --> 30:36.803
Let's see.

30:38.820 --> 30:39.840
Just you wait.

30:39.840 --> 30:41.913
Oh, I'm excited, lover boy.

30:46.634 --> 30:48.453
What? What is it?

30:50.957 --> 30:51.790
What?

30:55.770 --> 30:57.220
Ladies, they love you, too.

30:58.620 --> 31:00.930
Okay. And what else?

31:00.930 --> 31:02.340
I thought you didn't believe.

31:02.340 --> 31:03.173
I don't believe.

31:03.173 --> 31:04.680
I'm just, I don't know, curious.

31:04.680 --> 31:05.550
What else?

31:05.550 --> 31:07.470
What'd you see? Tell me.

31:07.470 --> 31:11.460
No, you have a strong faith but...

31:11.460 --> 31:12.310
But what?

31:14.457 --> 31:17.940
But you follow a false idol.

31:17.940 --> 31:19.410
Eh eh!

31:19.410 --> 31:21.873
Sorry, doll, you whiffed that one.

31:22.721 --> 31:23.554
What you have there

31:23.554 --> 31:25.650
is a non-believer of the highest order.

31:25.650 --> 31:27.150
He doesn't even believe in luck.

31:27.150 --> 31:30.423
He believes, just not for long.

31:37.860 --> 31:38.913
Another drink?

31:39.990 --> 31:42.663
Yeah, sure. Why not?

31:46.313 --> 31:48.270
Look at this.

31:48.270 --> 31:50.220
Tam is sparing no expense, huh?

31:50.220 --> 31:51.810
Courtesy of management, sir.

31:51.810 --> 31:52.683
I bet it is.

32:06.180 --> 32:07.380
What's wrong with you?

32:15.157 --> 32:17.160
Hey, hey, we don't
want those doors open.

32:17.160 --> 32:19.761
It's important. For the meal, sir.

32:19.761 --> 32:21.438
The view is part of the menu.

32:21.438 --> 32:22.512
- I don't care about the view.
- Relax!

32:22.512 --> 32:24.450
Close the curtains and the door.

32:24.450 --> 32:25.531
Just close 'em.

32:25.531 --> 32:26.364
Hey, come on, you grump.

32:26.364 --> 32:27.197
I love this.
- Why this yelling?

32:27.197 --> 32:28.947
Look, you can see for miles here.

32:32.023 --> 32:33.501
Down!

32:33.501 --> 32:35.198
Take cover!

32:35.198 --> 32:37.714
Move, move, move!

32:40.108 --> 32:40.992
Ken, you good?

32:40.992 --> 32:43.410
Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.

32:43.410 --> 32:44.367
You see him?

32:44.367 --> 32:46.317
Yeah, he's in that tower southwest.

32:47.150 --> 32:48.000
Fuck!

32:48.000 --> 32:49.440
This asshole can't shoot for shit.

32:49.440 --> 32:51.916
Skyscraper glass, reinforced.

32:51.916 --> 32:52.749
Fuck!

32:52.749 --> 32:54.906
The shots are off.

32:54.906 --> 32:56.370
We need to shut those drapes.

32:56.370 --> 32:57.390
Where's that remote?

32:57.390 --> 32:58.620
Got it? Give it to me.

32:58.620 --> 33:00.168
Give it to me!

33:00.168 --> 33:02.239
Fuck!

33:11.242 --> 33:13.463
Sam! Keep your head down.

33:13.463 --> 33:14.782
I know! I got this.

33:44.537 --> 33:45.585
Watch the fucking sniper

33:45.585 --> 33:47.273
that's trying to fucking kill you!

33:57.300 --> 33:59.073
Shit. Fuck him up, Sam.

34:02.236 --> 34:03.069
Come on then, bitch.

34:03.069 --> 34:04.294
Fuck you, pussy.

34:26.250 --> 34:28.140
Sam, come on, stop fooling with him!

34:28.140 --> 34:29.133
I'm not toying with him.

34:29.133 --> 34:30.854
He's fucking good.

34:40.290 --> 34:41.556
Who do you work for?

34:41.556 --> 34:43.723
Fuck you! Pussy.

34:58.740 --> 35:02.580
Shit! The goddamn curtains are open!

35:02.580 --> 35:05.040
Focus, Sam. Focus!

35:05.040 --> 35:06.390
Two assholes down.

35:06.390 --> 35:08.756
Two across the way to go. Focus!

35:08.756 --> 35:11.237
- Okay.
- What is happening? Why?

35:11.237 --> 35:12.900
Quiet! Quiet.

35:12.900 --> 35:13.950
Sam, your phone?

35:13.950 --> 35:17.220
Uh, it's in my jacket in the bedroom.

35:17.220 --> 35:18.330
What about yours?

35:18.330 --> 35:19.950
Out of reach.

35:19.950 --> 35:21.120
What about your case?

35:21.120 --> 35:22.920
Case is on the bar. We can't get to it.

35:22.920 --> 35:24.630
Where's your sidearm?

35:24.630 --> 35:27.180
It's in, it's in the
safe in the bedroom.

35:27.180 --> 35:28.170
You put it in the safe?

35:28.170 --> 35:30.412
Why did you put it in the goddamn safe?

35:30.412 --> 35:33.240
I don't know. I just wanted
to put it in a safe place.

35:33.240 --> 35:34.073
Shit!

35:34.073 --> 35:36.660
Fuck! I'm losing my cover here.

35:36.660 --> 35:37.510
All right, Ken.

35:38.567 --> 35:40.410
You got a spot to move to?

35:40.410 --> 35:41.733
Got it. Hold.

35:45.660 --> 35:47.644
Okay. Got it.

35:47.644 --> 35:49.294
All right, get ready. On three.

35:50.400 --> 35:52.533
One, two, three!

35:54.395 --> 35:56.291
Ah, fuck! Shit!

35:56.291 --> 35:57.124
Fuck!

35:57.124 --> 35:58.717
That bullet went past my ass cheek.

35:58.717 --> 36:00.512
That shit was hot.

36:00.512 --> 36:01.345
Are you good?

36:01.345 --> 36:03.027
Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.

36:04.770 --> 36:07.110
Lily. Lily, listen to me.

36:07.110 --> 36:09.930
Lily, it's gonna be okay.
Just stay calm, okay?

36:09.930 --> 36:11.550
Keep your head down.

36:11.550 --> 36:12.450
Just keep your head down.

36:12.450 --> 36:13.500
Does she understand what I'm saying?

36:13.500 --> 36:15.869
Tell her to keep her head down.

36:28.696 --> 36:29.847
You got any thoughts?

36:29.847 --> 36:31.110
Uh, besides, we're fucked?

36:31.110 --> 36:32.580
Yeah, besides, we're fucked.

36:32.580 --> 36:34.653
Let me have a think. None.

36:36.210 --> 36:38.280
Come on, Ken, this
is what you do, right?

36:38.280 --> 36:39.420
This is your shit.

36:39.420 --> 36:40.680
What should we do? Think about it.

36:40.680 --> 36:43.020
Yeah. Yeah, okay.

36:43.020 --> 36:44.430
Yeah, I got this.

36:44.430 --> 36:45.957
Ah, let me think.

36:45.957 --> 36:49.560
Uh, uh, the lights!

36:49.560 --> 36:50.580
Lights.

36:50.580 --> 36:52.630
We can take a couple of lights out. Okay?

36:54.060 --> 36:55.563
Yeah. Good call, bro.

36:59.670 --> 37:00.720
That'll do for now.

37:01.560 --> 37:02.670
But there are still lights.

37:02.670 --> 37:04.290
No, no, no, we don't
want it completely dark.

37:04.290 --> 37:05.160
Why? Then they can-

37:05.160 --> 37:06.600
They have night vision scopes on,

37:06.600 --> 37:09.150
half light is better than no light, okay?

37:09.150 --> 37:11.790
You two girls, who has a phone here?

37:11.790 --> 37:13.050
I do.
- Where?

37:13.050 --> 37:14.430
In, in my bag.

37:14.430 --> 37:15.263
Where's your bag?

37:15.263 --> 37:16.350
Over by the table.

37:16.350 --> 37:19.110
Ah, fuck! It might as well be in China.

37:19.110 --> 37:20.310
Hey, what about her?

37:20.310 --> 37:21.720
Is it Lily?

37:21.720 --> 37:23.703
Lily, talk! Talk to me.

37:24.690 --> 37:25.830
Talk to me.

37:36.510 --> 37:38.760
She's so scared, she's
forgetting English.

37:38.760 --> 37:39.630
In her bag, too,

37:39.630 --> 37:41.280
but she doesn't know where it is.

37:41.280 --> 37:42.930
Well, let's take a look for it.

37:43.830 --> 37:46.260
Mona, stay down! Stay down!

37:46.260 --> 37:47.430
Don't move.

37:47.430 --> 37:49.050
Sam, you see her?

37:49.050 --> 37:50.400
Yeah, I can see her.

37:50.400 --> 37:52.260
Mona, watch Sam for cues.

37:52.260 --> 37:53.790
Do not move until he says different.

37:53.790 --> 37:55.083
Okay? You're safe there.

37:59.010 --> 38:00.560
Ken, what are you doing, bro?

38:01.620 --> 38:04.800
A fucked up version of
Tetris with live ammunition.

38:04.800 --> 38:07.110
All right, just make
sure you don't get shot.

38:07.110 --> 38:08.673
Oh, okay. Thanks, Dad.

38:10.260 --> 38:12.210
Bingo, baby. I see it.

38:12.210 --> 38:13.110
See what?

38:13.110 --> 38:14.010
The purse.

38:14.010 --> 38:14.843
Can you get to it?

38:14.843 --> 38:16.200
Hang tight, folks.

38:16.200 --> 38:17.033
This is gonna sting.

38:17.033 --> 38:18.113
All right. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

38:18.113 --> 38:18.960
Wait. Wait.

38:18.960 --> 38:21.990
Mona, Ken's gonna dive behind the pillar.

38:21.990 --> 38:23.970
When he does that, you need to come to me.

38:23.970 --> 38:24.803
Can you do that?

38:26.160 --> 38:27.000
Yeah?

38:27.000 --> 38:29.523
Ready? Ready, Ken?

38:30.630 --> 38:32.026
Right. Three, two, one.

38:32.026 --> 38:32.859
Go!

38:32.859 --> 38:34.250
Come on! Move, move, move!

38:34.250 --> 38:35.582
Oh, fuck!

38:37.289 --> 38:39.510
Yeah! Keep trying, sucker.

38:39.510 --> 38:40.530
I've been dodging bullets

38:40.530 --> 38:42.338
since I was an itch in my dad's pants.

38:42.338 --> 38:45.330
Goddamn it, you lunatic!

38:45.330 --> 38:47.283
Yeah. Yeah, you're welcome, man.

38:48.600 --> 38:51.750
You know, Sam, I've been thinking.

38:51.750 --> 38:52.583
About what?

38:53.520 --> 38:56.610
I watched a game of baseball last night.

38:56.610 --> 38:58.710
It's not as boring as I thought.

38:58.710 --> 39:00.660
Come on, come on, come on.

39:00.660 --> 39:02.100
I tried to tell you, bro.

39:05.459 --> 39:07.271
No! Down!

39:08.403 --> 39:09.236
Stay down.

39:09.236 --> 39:12.451
Stay down! Tell her to stay down!

39:15.014 --> 39:16.505
Lily! Lily.

39:18.455 --> 39:20.361
Stay calm, okay?

39:20.361 --> 39:22.041
Okay, just stay down.

39:22.041 --> 39:24.132
Alright? I got you.

39:24.132 --> 39:25.908
Okay. I'm not gonna let you go.

39:25.908 --> 39:27.600
I got you. Just stay calm.

39:27.600 --> 39:29.880
Ken, she's fucking losing it, bro.

39:29.880 --> 39:31.770
Ah, just hang tight.

39:31.770 --> 39:33.000
I nearly got it.

39:33.000 --> 39:34.500
Oh, yeah, baby!

39:34.500 --> 39:36.510
I got it. I got it!

39:36.510 --> 39:38.760
Come on. All right.

39:38.760 --> 39:41.190
I need her uh, I need her
security code for the phone.

39:41.190 --> 39:42.229
What is it?

39:49.200 --> 39:50.640
I need the security code.

39:50.640 --> 39:52.500
I need the security
code in English, please.

39:52.500 --> 39:54.003
5150.

39:55.650 --> 39:56.823
All right, come on.

40:02.970 --> 40:04.440
Ocean Valley Insurance.

40:04.440 --> 40:05.610
How may I direct your call?

40:05.610 --> 40:07.680
Claims case 6661.

40:07.680 --> 40:09.453
Please
hold while we verify.

40:12.720 --> 40:14.580
Ken, why are
you calling on this number?

40:14.580 --> 40:15.413
Better not be a code-

40:15.413 --> 40:18.000
Code blue? Yeah, we're under fire.

40:18.000 --> 40:20.790
Okay, just keep
talking. Where are you?

40:20.790 --> 40:22.293
The hotel, penthouse.

40:23.310 --> 40:26.190
There's nothing but windows
and very little cover.

40:26.190 --> 40:28.321
Sam and I are pinned
down, but we're alive.

40:28.321 --> 40:29.154
Mm-hmm.

40:29.154 --> 40:31.380
Sam, anything to add to that?

40:31.380 --> 40:33.540
Yeah, hurry up and get
us the fuck outta here.

40:33.540 --> 40:36.480
Any idea
who we're dealing with?

40:36.480 --> 40:38.040
I don't know, but the
shooter's in a tower

40:38.040 --> 40:39.450
to my southwest.

40:39.450 --> 40:41.910
Looks like uh, an apartment building,

40:41.910 --> 40:43.260
an office space, something like that.

40:43.260 --> 40:44.250
Either way, we're trapped,

40:44.250 --> 40:46.170
and we need to get the fuck out of here.

40:46.170 --> 40:47.003
Penthouse?

40:47.003 --> 40:48.031
That's where you put us.

40:48.031 --> 40:49.551
I did not.

40:49.551 --> 40:51.030
Whose phone are you using?

40:51.030 --> 40:52.620
The massage girls you sent up as a gift,

40:52.620 --> 40:54.540
which I'm presuming is absolute-

40:54.540 --> 40:56.130
Bullshit.
- Yeah.

40:56.130 --> 40:58.221
They had the word of the day, Tam.

40:58.221 --> 40:59.970
Are they still there? Alive?

40:59.970 --> 41:03.090
Yeah. There's a, there's a dead merc

41:03.090 --> 41:05.400
and, the concierge was in on it, too.

41:05.400 --> 41:07.380
The guy was a secret fucking ninja.

41:07.380 --> 41:09.191
But the girls are civilian.

41:09.191 --> 41:10.089
Are you sure?

41:10.089 --> 41:12.427
Yeah. They're scared to
death and not faking it.

41:12.427 --> 41:13.344
I can tell.

41:15.181 --> 41:17.573
Then how did they
get the word of the day?

41:18.570 --> 41:20.400
We have a mole, Tam.

41:20.400 --> 41:21.603
Someone set us up.

41:22.770 --> 41:24.300
How many people knew we'd be here?

41:24.300 --> 41:27.210
It's a very short list.

41:27.210 --> 41:29.610
Look, this penthouse is
running out of cover fast.

41:29.610 --> 41:30.810
We need help.

41:30.810 --> 41:32.370
Any more assets in town?

41:32.370 --> 41:33.960
I have some favours to call in.

41:33.960 --> 41:35.820
Keep the line open and sit tight.

41:35.820 --> 41:37.420
Like we have a fucking choice.

41:38.820 --> 41:40.070
You heard the lady, kids.

41:41.070 --> 41:42.660
Turtle up.

41:42.660 --> 41:43.773
Ah, fuck.

41:44.970 --> 41:46.137
Are they-
- We're okay, we're okay.

41:46.137 --> 41:47.970
Are they sending someone to help?

41:47.970 --> 41:50.884
Yeah. They're sending someone to help.

41:50.884 --> 41:51.717
We're gonna be okay.

41:51.717 --> 41:52.550
You just got to keep your heads down.

41:52.550 --> 41:53.383
You understand?

41:53.383 --> 41:55.482
Tell her. Keep your head down.

41:57.330 --> 41:58.740
That building over there.

41:58.740 --> 42:00.590
No, no, no, don't look. Don't look.

42:00.590 --> 42:02.490
If you can see them, that
means they can see you.

42:02.490 --> 42:03.780
That's bad.

42:03.780 --> 42:05.610
Keep your head down. Alright?

42:05.610 --> 42:06.780
They're not gonna waste their ammo.

42:06.780 --> 42:07.980
They're gonna choose their shots.

42:07.980 --> 42:10.410
They're looking for a kill shot. Okay?

42:10.410 --> 42:11.410
Keep your head down.

42:17.130 --> 42:18.830
Why are they trying to kill you?

42:22.604 --> 42:23.854
I don't know.

42:25.110 --> 42:27.123
You did something, didn't you?

42:29.040 --> 42:30.660
We've done many things.

42:30.660 --> 42:32.310
That's not why this is happening.

42:33.780 --> 42:35.040
I don't want to die.

42:35.040 --> 42:36.180
I can't die here.

42:36.180 --> 42:37.440
You're not gonna die here.

42:37.440 --> 42:38.520
I have a daughter.

42:38.520 --> 42:39.840
Yeah, you're gonna see her again.

42:39.840 --> 42:40.673
Trust me.

42:43.080 --> 42:45.480
Oh God, please help us.

42:45.480 --> 42:48.000
Hey, hey. It's all right, hon.

42:48.000 --> 42:48.840
Cavalry's coming.

42:48.840 --> 42:50.760
Just sit tight.
Who?

42:50.760 --> 42:51.870
The cavalry.

42:51.870 --> 42:55.980
You know? The good guys.

42:55.980 --> 42:59.010
Oh, good guys like you.

42:59.010 --> 43:00.183
Yeah. Like me.

43:01.260 --> 43:04.680
If you're such a good guy,

43:04.680 --> 43:07.050
then why is someone trying to kill you?

43:07.050 --> 43:09.720
I told you, I don't know yet.

43:09.720 --> 43:10.623
What did you do?

43:11.820 --> 43:15.423
Hurt someone and now
they want to hurt you.

43:16.710 --> 43:18.270
Yes?

43:18.270 --> 43:19.173
Probably, yeah.

43:20.280 --> 43:22.113
Yet, you are the good guy.

43:26.340 --> 43:27.690
We try to be, okay?

43:27.690 --> 43:29.250
Well, try harder.

43:29.250 --> 43:31.290
He's speaking for himself.

43:31.290 --> 43:32.493
I like being a bad dude.

43:34.747 --> 43:36.556
What?

43:38.140 --> 43:38.973
What are you saying?

43:38.973 --> 43:39.806
What, what, what's she saying?

43:39.806 --> 43:41.090
God is love and love is real.

43:42.270 --> 43:44.538
It's gonna be okay.

43:44.538 --> 43:45.371
You're gonna be okay.

43:45.371 --> 43:47.903
Look, I'm gonna get you
both out of this, okay?

43:52.267 --> 43:54.270
How old's your daughter?

43:54.270 --> 43:55.440
Eight.

43:55.440 --> 43:56.273
Yeah?

43:58.020 --> 43:59.520
What's her name?

43:59.520 --> 44:01.560
Her name is none of your
fucking business, okay?

44:01.560 --> 44:04.533
That's her name.
- Okay, okay, fine. Okay.

44:09.983 --> 44:11.703
You are no soldier.

44:13.350 --> 44:14.703
I know what you are.

44:15.930 --> 44:18.213
I've seen many of your kind around here.

44:19.740 --> 44:22.140
You call yourself a soldier,

44:22.140 --> 44:24.783
but really, you are just a killer.

44:26.310 --> 44:27.420
I've read it on your palms.

44:27.420 --> 44:28.443
You kill for money.

44:29.375 --> 44:30.630
And what do you do for money, huh?

44:30.630 --> 44:31.680
You know what I do.

44:31.680 --> 44:33.960
Yeah. You sell your ass.

44:33.960 --> 44:34.800
Don't lecture us.

44:34.800 --> 44:37.653
I do what I must to
take care of my child.

44:38.940 --> 44:40.110
Why do you do what you do?

44:40.110 --> 44:41.367
We protect people.

44:41.367 --> 44:43.923
Oh, doing a bang up job so far.

44:49.080 --> 44:51.000
Is that your mirror?

44:51.000 --> 44:52.770
Yeah.
Yeah?

44:52.770 --> 44:54.873
Give it to me. Quickly.

45:00.831 --> 45:01.664
Okay.

45:11.880 --> 45:13.410
Who was it that hired you for us tonight?

45:13.410 --> 45:15.570
We got a call from Mirko the concierge.

45:15.570 --> 45:17.280
He said we were a gift.

45:17.280 --> 45:18.278
Sam! Look out!

45:25.443 --> 45:26.276
Sam! Shit!

45:27.120 --> 45:28.263
Sam, hang on.

45:48.809 --> 45:50.446
I can't get to you.

45:59.160 --> 46:00.570
Ken, you good?

46:00.570 --> 46:02.253
Yeah, yeah. I'm good.

46:03.810 --> 46:05.313
You uh, you see the phone?

46:06.235 --> 46:07.233
The phone?

46:09.030 --> 46:09.863
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

46:09.863 --> 46:11.223
I got it. Hang on.

46:13.560 --> 46:14.710
Yeah. Got it.

46:19.359 --> 46:20.192
Good.

46:22.443 --> 46:23.373
Hey, Ken.

46:24.600 --> 46:26.040
Yeah.

46:26.040 --> 46:28.803
Thanks, bro. You saved my life.

46:32.010 --> 46:32.951
Don't worry about it.

46:37.703 --> 46:40.860
Ken?

46:40.860 --> 46:41.693
Ken?

46:42.810 --> 46:43.643
Fuck!

46:46.744 --> 46:47.613
Oh, Shit.

46:48.843 --> 46:49.676
Ken!

46:53.712 --> 46:55.210
Ken!

46:55.210 --> 46:56.433
Fuck! Fuck!

46:58.920 --> 46:59.883
Shit!

47:01.710 --> 47:02.673
Goddamn it!

47:03.960 --> 47:04.793
Fuck.

47:08.100 --> 47:08.933
Ken!

47:10.176 --> 47:13.383
I, I think he's, he's still breathing.

47:15.325 --> 47:17.040
He's breathing?

47:17.040 --> 47:18.420
Yes.

47:18.420 --> 47:19.270
You sure?

47:20.610 --> 47:23.155
Bleeding, but, but still breathing.

47:23.155 --> 47:25.920
Oh thank God. Thank God.

47:25.920 --> 47:27.690
Fuck! Come on, Tam.

47:27.690 --> 47:29.690
Please, please Tam!

47:36.885 --> 47:38.102
What's she saying?

47:38.102 --> 47:38.935
What did she say?

47:38.935 --> 47:40.440
She's scared. What do you think?

47:40.440 --> 47:42.750
She's afraid we're gonna die up here.

47:42.750 --> 47:44.493
All right. You tell her.

47:45.497 --> 47:46.800
This is how it's gonna be. Okay?

47:46.800 --> 47:49.250
I'm gonna get us out of this. I just...

47:51.000 --> 47:52.300
She doesn't believe you.

47:53.640 --> 47:57.690
A killer's word means nothing to anyone.

47:57.690 --> 47:59.970
I told you, I'm a soldier, okay?

47:59.970 --> 48:00.960
We protect people.

48:00.960 --> 48:02.820
We only kill bad guys,

48:02.820 --> 48:04.470
only if we don't have another choice.

48:04.470 --> 48:08.283
According to who? Your government.

48:09.810 --> 48:11.860
You really think that makes a difference?

48:15.180 --> 48:17.163
When my baby girl was only one,

48:18.090 --> 48:20.373
her father was gunned down in the street.

48:21.600 --> 48:24.873
Why? Because he thought my
husband was someone else.

48:26.370 --> 48:31.370
This killer also worked
for the government.

48:33.180 --> 48:34.473
But they got it wrong.

48:36.210 --> 48:38.230
And it cost my husband his life

48:39.330 --> 48:40.773
and my daughter her father.

48:44.460 --> 48:47.493
That killer thought he had good
reason for what he did too.

48:57.360 --> 48:59.010
Please give me some good news.

48:59.010 --> 49:01.920
Sam, what's wrong? Where's Ken?

49:01.920 --> 49:03.420
He's down. He's hit.

49:03.420 --> 49:04.253
He's unconscious.

49:04.253 --> 49:06.570
I can't get to him, but he's bleeding.

49:06.570 --> 49:07.920
We need a medic up here, Tam.

49:07.920 --> 49:09.543
Now! Quickly!

49:10.380 --> 49:12.090
Ken's a tough nut to crack.

49:12.090 --> 49:13.100
He'll make it.

49:13.100 --> 49:14.343
Do you have a visual?

49:15.870 --> 49:19.143
Hang on. I'm using a mirror.

49:24.090 --> 49:25.323
Okay, go.

49:26.670 --> 49:28.080
I have a team almost there.

49:28.080 --> 49:29.253
Watch for the flashes.

49:30.120 --> 49:30.953
Watching.

49:30.953 --> 49:33.260
Five, four, three...

49:35.187 --> 49:37.530
Are we clear? Is that confirmed?

49:37.530 --> 49:39.690
I need rock solid fucking confirmation

49:39.690 --> 49:40.863
before he can move.

49:42.021 --> 49:43.200
Clear.

49:43.200 --> 49:44.813
Room is
clear. You're good, Sam.

49:50.490 --> 49:51.990
It's safe?

49:51.990 --> 49:52.823
We're good.

49:52.823 --> 49:54.090
I'll send the team over to you.

49:54.090 --> 49:56.250
Chances are they may have
assets in your hotel,

49:56.250 --> 49:59.310
so just stay calm, stay on the line,

49:59.310 --> 50:02.269
and you can stop hiding
behind that pillar.

50:02.269 --> 50:03.469
Did you find the mole?

50:03.469 --> 50:04.302
No...

50:04.302 --> 50:05.973
No, Sam. Not yet.

50:05.973 --> 50:07.683
I've been very busy.

50:09.300 --> 50:10.133
Is it safe?

50:15.390 --> 50:17.310
She said it's safe?

50:17.310 --> 50:18.824
Yeah. It's safe.

50:18.824 --> 50:20.423
You sure?

50:20.423 --> 50:21.256
Yeah.

50:21.256 --> 50:22.890
Why do you believe them?

50:22.890 --> 50:25.440
Look, I just saw the
flashes myself, okay?

50:25.440 --> 50:26.700
It's safe. We're clear.

50:26.700 --> 50:27.573
You first then.

50:44.490 --> 50:45.990
You see, I told you.

50:45.990 --> 50:47.267
So go. Do it.

50:48.630 --> 50:51.180
Get out from behind that
pillar, if you're so sure.

50:54.960 --> 50:56.970
Hey, Tam, you got eyes on us?

50:56.970 --> 50:59.463
Not yet. I'm working on it.

51:00.352 --> 51:01.752
Then how did you know I was

51:01.752 --> 51:02.585
behind the pillar?

51:05.910 --> 51:07.673
Fuck!

51:11.880 --> 51:13.023
Nice try, Tam.

51:14.658 --> 51:15.840
You even got me to check the flashes

51:15.840 --> 51:17.790
so I'd be convinced you cleared the room.

51:17.790 --> 51:21.333
That's smart. (laughs) Very smart.

51:23.310 --> 51:24.240
Sam?

51:24.240 --> 51:25.710
How the hell did I not realise

51:25.710 --> 51:28.759
what a fucking liar you were before now?

51:28.759 --> 51:33.759
I
mean, people tend to see

51:34.140 --> 51:37.383
what they want to be
true rather than what is.

51:38.550 --> 51:40.300
What the fuck are you doing, Tam?

51:41.190 --> 51:42.780
What are you up to?

51:42.780 --> 51:44.280
We're firing you.

51:44.280 --> 51:45.690
You insisted on it.

51:45.690 --> 51:46.523
Goddamn it!

51:46.523 --> 51:48.630
How could you do this to
me after all these years.

51:48.630 --> 51:49.919
Fuck!

51:49.919 --> 51:52.020
I like you, Sam, but I don't see things

51:52.020 --> 51:52.980
in terms of right and wrong.

51:52.980 --> 51:54.690
That's not what I'm paid to do.

51:54.690 --> 51:55.890
My job is to solve problems.

51:55.890 --> 51:59.276
And the problem is, we
have a man like you...

51:59.276 --> 52:00.720
who has a very specific skill set,

52:00.720 --> 52:02.370
who doesn't want to work for
us anymore, which is fine.

52:02.370 --> 52:03.480
But what we can't have

52:03.480 --> 52:05.490
is you working for one of our competitors.

52:05.490 --> 52:07.653
So you know the solution.

52:08.820 --> 52:11.790
The solution is, you know,
we take you off the board.

52:11.790 --> 52:13.680
I was loyal to you.

52:13.680 --> 52:16.680
Yes, you were,
but our profile on you

52:16.680 --> 52:18.480
suggests you have too much empathy

52:18.480 --> 52:20.130
and you're losing your edge, Sam.

52:20.130 --> 52:21.450
So it's only a matter of time

52:21.450 --> 52:22.800
before you're triggered
in the wrong direction

52:22.800 --> 52:27.240
and you become a serious
risk if you turn on us.

52:27.240 --> 52:28.890
So just come on out,

52:28.890 --> 52:33.783
wave hello and we can all fucking move on.

52:34.920 --> 52:36.810
Why not just me? Why Ken?

52:36.810 --> 52:39.180
Ken talked too
much. It's not personal.

52:39.180 --> 52:42.330
It's how risk management works
in the private sector, Sam.

52:42.330 --> 52:44.010
It's far from the first
time, even for you.

52:44.010 --> 52:46.140
You know that.

52:46.140 --> 52:48.210
What the fuck are you talking about?

52:48.210 --> 52:50.610
How do you
think you two got started?

52:53.130 --> 52:55.536
Dubai ring any bells?

52:55.536 --> 52:56.925
You're saying we killed our own?

52:56.925 --> 52:59.010
Technically, you
removed a couple of liabilities.

52:59.010 --> 53:01.710
Now your replacements are
here to do the same thing.

53:01.710 --> 53:03.330
Sadly, I find them lacking.

53:03.330 --> 53:04.560
You only needed two shots.

53:04.560 --> 53:06.480
No bellhop or call girls.

53:06.480 --> 53:09.513
You were so good you
didn't even break a window.

53:10.680 --> 53:12.420
We're sorry to see you go.

53:12.420 --> 53:15.000
A great shooter like you as well.

53:15.000 --> 53:15.833
Priceless.

53:15.833 --> 53:17.880
Were any of my kills good?

53:17.880 --> 53:20.130
All our kills
are good kills, Sam.

53:21.900 --> 53:22.841
Fuck!

53:24.180 --> 53:25.013
Shit!

53:28.050 --> 53:30.090
What now? What's happening?

53:30.090 --> 53:31.140
We're being set up.

53:32.760 --> 53:33.990
Fucking bitch!

53:33.990 --> 53:35.813
You can't call for help.

53:35.813 --> 53:38.580
Can't call the police,
fire or anywhere else.

53:38.580 --> 53:40.530
I have control over all your comms.

53:40.530 --> 53:42.750
Any calls go out to me.

53:42.750 --> 53:46.315
Your line, Ken's, those whores'.

53:46.315 --> 53:47.815
Oh, okay. I see.

53:49.845 --> 53:51.300
You got it all figured out, don't you?

53:51.300 --> 53:53.160
We own the entire building.

53:53.160 --> 53:55.560
You have no cover, no exit plan.

53:55.560 --> 53:56.640
You're done.

53:56.640 --> 53:57.843
Why not make it quick?

54:00.720 --> 54:02.160
I do that, you'll let the women live?

54:02.160 --> 54:03.723
Of course.

54:04.830 --> 54:06.690
You give me your word.

54:06.690 --> 54:10.020
I die, they're free to go. Alive?

54:10.020 --> 54:11.133
Absolutely.

54:13.350 --> 54:14.183
You're lying.

54:14.183 --> 54:15.811
Of course I'm not.

54:15.811 --> 54:16.644
She lies.

54:16.644 --> 54:17.477
You know what, Tam?

54:17.477 --> 54:19.830
I think you've been
doing this job too long.

54:19.830 --> 54:22.500
You've forgotten what
sincerity actually sounds like.

54:22.500 --> 54:23.580
You're fucking lying.

54:23.580 --> 54:24.980
You're gonna kill them, too.

54:26.686 --> 54:27.540
Oh, dear.

54:27.540 --> 54:29.790
I sense disapproval from the cheap whore

54:29.790 --> 54:31.110
I sent up to relax you.

54:31.110 --> 54:32.700
I am not cheap!

54:32.700 --> 54:35.220
Tam, you want me so bad,

54:35.220 --> 54:38.520
why don't you come up here
and do it your fucking self?

54:38.520 --> 54:40.687
Sorry, Sam. I think not.

54:49.478 --> 54:50.556
Lily! Stay down!

54:50.556 --> 54:51.538
Lord Jesus, please-

54:53.642 --> 54:55.269
Lily, don't move!

54:56.935 --> 54:58.710
Mona, stay down. Get down!

54:58.710 --> 54:59.543
She's hurt...

54:59.543 --> 55:00.376
No! Get down!

55:00.376 --> 55:01.334
We have to help her!

55:01.334 --> 55:02.167
No! She's bait now!

55:02.167 --> 55:03.720
That's what they want.

55:03.720 --> 55:05.160
They're trying to draw you out.

55:05.160 --> 55:06.510
That's why they shot to wound.

55:06.510 --> 55:08.264
We can't...
- Stay there!

55:09.221 --> 55:10.140
Lily!

55:10.140 --> 55:10.973
Look at me, Mona.

55:10.973 --> 55:13.920
- Please!
- Mona! Mona, look at me.

55:13.920 --> 55:17.280
Alright, I'm gonna do something, okay?

55:17.280 --> 55:20.130
When I go, he's gonna be shooting at me.

55:20.130 --> 55:20.963
You get to Lily.

55:20.963 --> 55:22.800
You pull her into safety fast.

55:22.800 --> 55:24.379
Okay?

55:24.379 --> 55:26.130
When I say. When I say.

55:26.130 --> 55:26.963
You ready?

55:29.570 --> 55:31.099
Go!

55:34.170 --> 55:35.692
Lily!

55:35.692 --> 55:36.609
Lily! Lily!

55:38.342 --> 55:39.735
Oh! Lily.

55:48.240 --> 55:49.157
Lily, Lily.

55:53.419 --> 55:54.252
Fuck!

55:55.398 --> 55:57.415
Okay Lily, look at me.

55:57.415 --> 56:00.413
You're gonna be okay. Okay?

56:00.413 --> 56:03.234
We're gonna get out of here, okay?

56:06.994 --> 56:11.811
Lily, Lily, Lily!

56:27.617 --> 56:31.980
Sam, this is
Ken's skill set, not yours.

56:31.980 --> 56:33.990
Stop embarrassing yourself.

56:33.990 --> 56:34.823
You're the one who replaced me

56:34.823 --> 56:37.380
with a fucking moron who can't hit shit.

56:37.380 --> 56:40.500
Bet your lady
friend's spine feels differently.

56:40.500 --> 56:43.050
She's dying, Sam. You know that.

56:43.050 --> 56:44.970
Just stop it. It's over.

56:44.970 --> 56:46.980
She was dead the moment
she set foot in there.

56:46.980 --> 56:48.390
You risked your life for nothing.

56:48.390 --> 56:49.893
You're all dead, you know it.

56:51.060 --> 56:53.155
Why keep torturing yourself?

56:53.155 --> 56:54.210
You've been on the other side of this.

56:54.210 --> 56:56.340
You know how it ends.

56:56.340 --> 56:58.707
Too much open area. No cover.

57:03.342 --> 57:04.259
No cover.

57:07.380 --> 57:11.460
Ah, you're not
making it to your rifle,

57:11.460 --> 57:13.710
not without sticking
some part of your body up

57:13.710 --> 57:15.330
that we can shoot.

57:15.330 --> 57:17.070
You can't get to the bar.

57:17.070 --> 57:19.290
You can't get to the elevator.

57:19.290 --> 57:20.190
You can't get out.

57:21.090 --> 57:22.470
Full stop.

57:22.470 --> 57:24.600
End of story, Sam.

57:24.600 --> 57:26.403
So go on, turtle up.

57:27.270 --> 57:28.984
We've got all night.

57:54.903 --> 57:58.233
Hey, Mona, mind if I use this?

57:59.220 --> 58:02.493
That's why I have it, for luck.

58:04.980 --> 58:07.203
Yeah, for luck.

58:26.473 --> 58:28.480
I was trying to keep this clean

58:29.940 --> 58:32.073
out of respect for you, Sam.

58:33.723 --> 58:37.540
But now it's gonna have to get real

58:38.490 --> 58:41.733
fucking messy.

58:43.050 --> 58:45.933
Hey, Tam, when I get outta this,

58:46.830 --> 58:48.423
and I am gonna get out of this,

58:50.160 --> 58:51.570
I'm coming to get you.

58:51.570 --> 58:53.727
That'd be a neat trick,

58:53.727 --> 58:55.833
but I don't even think you believe that.

59:04.530 --> 59:05.730
I'm sorry, Mona.

59:07.230 --> 59:11.763
She was 20 fucking two, a child.

59:25.470 --> 59:26.433
What do we do now?

59:30.900 --> 59:31.733
We wait.

59:34.110 --> 59:37.230
If we can wait long enough
for the sun to come up,

59:37.230 --> 59:39.330
it's gonna be right in the shooter's eyes.

59:41.100 --> 59:42.630
It's very hard to shoot into the sun.

59:42.630 --> 59:44.670
It gives us a small window if we're fast.

59:44.670 --> 59:46.893
Sunrise, that's the best you got?

59:48.420 --> 59:49.620
Right now it is, yeah.

59:52.560 --> 59:54.810
Assuming Tamara hasn't
sent up any more assets,

59:54.810 --> 59:56.520
and that's a pretty
fucking big assumption,

59:56.520 --> 59:58.563
we sit tight and we wait.

01:00:03.660 --> 01:00:05.710
So usually that's you on the other end?

01:00:06.810 --> 01:00:08.823
The shooter, that's you?

01:00:10.710 --> 01:00:11.543
Yeah.

01:00:13.080 --> 01:00:14.730
So you know what he's thinking.

01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:18.113
Yeah.

01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:21.830
And he knows
what you're thinking.

01:00:23.940 --> 01:00:24.773
Yeah.

01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:28.730
Isn't he worried about the sunrise?

01:00:30.060 --> 01:00:31.710
Not at all.

01:00:31.710 --> 01:00:32.560
Why not?

01:00:33.721 --> 01:00:35.783
'Cause he figures we're
gonna run before then.

01:00:36.630 --> 01:00:39.390
Figures we won't be able to wait it out.

01:00:39.390 --> 01:00:41.400
And even if we do wait
'til the sun comes up,

01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:44.460
by then we're gonna be cold and sore,

01:00:44.460 --> 01:00:46.440
cramped up and...

01:00:46.440 --> 01:00:47.880
Easy to kill.

01:00:47.880 --> 01:00:50.553
Easier. Yeah.

01:00:53.340 --> 01:00:55.043
What is he thinking right now?

01:00:57.040 --> 01:00:58.990
Well, right now he's gonna be pissed.

01:01:00.510 --> 01:01:02.850
See, this was supposed
to be a 10 second job.

01:01:02.850 --> 01:01:05.910
One, two, three bang. Done.

01:01:05.910 --> 01:01:07.823
Nobody was supposed to know what hit 'em.

01:01:09.284 --> 01:01:11.513
But I went and fucked all
that up for them, didn't I?

01:01:12.567 --> 01:01:16.830
And the longer we wait,
the angrier he's gonna get.

01:01:16.830 --> 01:01:19.803
But he's not hot. He's not raging.

01:01:21.330 --> 01:01:25.053
He's calm, he's cool, collected.

01:01:25.890 --> 01:01:29.460
You see, it's a battle of wills,
and he's determined to win.

01:01:29.460 --> 01:01:32.350
He's thinking about nothing except for me

01:01:33.240 --> 01:01:34.860
and the shot.

01:01:34.860 --> 01:01:36.633
The target and the bullet.

01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:39.603
It's clean. It's pure.

01:01:41.010 --> 01:01:42.180
It's relaxing too.

01:01:42.180 --> 01:01:44.223
I know that sounds fucked up, but it is.

01:01:45.150 --> 01:01:48.420
'Cause there is nothing
clouding your mind.

01:01:48.420 --> 01:01:50.010
Only the job.

01:01:50.010 --> 01:01:52.800
No bills. No worries.

01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:55.980
Just the shot. And then...

01:01:55.980 --> 01:01:56.813
What?

01:02:00.810 --> 01:02:01.643
He's dead.

01:02:03.750 --> 01:02:04.583
You're not.

01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:07.433
That's it.

01:02:09.540 --> 01:02:11.090
How could you do such things?

01:02:13.140 --> 01:02:15.303
You just take life.

01:02:17.580 --> 01:02:18.413
How?

01:02:25.729 --> 01:02:26.730
I need to get that rifle.

01:02:31.260 --> 01:02:33.206
They're coming! Take cover!

01:03:49.918 --> 01:03:51.347
Eye for an eye.

01:04:42.297 --> 01:04:43.396
- Get him! Get him!
- Hey!

01:04:43.396 --> 01:04:44.550
- Get him!
- Hey!

01:04:44.550 --> 01:04:46.320
- Gun down!
- Let go of her!

01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:48.630
Drop the weapon! Drop it!

01:04:48.630 --> 01:04:49.770
Don't listen.

01:04:49.770 --> 01:04:53.280
- Drop it.
- Okay. Okay.

01:04:53.280 --> 01:04:54.660
Alright.
- Drop the weapon!

01:04:54.660 --> 01:04:55.590
I'm putting it down.

01:04:55.590 --> 01:04:57.183
Just stay calm. Don't hurt her.

01:04:58.263 --> 01:04:59.370
Rifle too. One hand.

01:04:59.370 --> 01:05:03.000
Alright, let's take it easy, okay?

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.210
Putting the rifle down, real slow.

01:05:06.701 --> 01:05:08.618
- Don't listen.
- Okay?

01:05:11.305 --> 01:05:12.533
Don't do anything stupid.

01:05:25.642 --> 01:05:28.229
Think you can just light
a motherfucker on fire?

01:05:28.229 --> 01:05:30.173
I'll skin you alive!

01:05:45.624 --> 01:05:47.207
Come on, come on.

01:05:50.412 --> 01:05:51.706
You okay?
Yes.

01:05:51.706 --> 01:05:53.789
You okay?
Yes.

01:06:06.090 --> 01:06:10.233
Thank you for saving my life.

01:06:12.090 --> 01:06:16.020
I told you. That's why I do this.

01:06:16.020 --> 01:06:16.983
To protect people.

01:06:18.150 --> 01:06:19.750
When did you become a soldier?

01:06:24.756 --> 01:06:28.110
You know when those two
planes went into the towers,

01:06:28.110 --> 01:06:29.883
the World Trade Centre came down.

01:06:32.084 --> 01:06:33.330
It scared the shit outta me.

01:06:33.330 --> 01:06:34.473
That's why I enlisted.

01:06:35.940 --> 01:06:38.220
I was just a kid, 18.

01:06:38.220 --> 01:06:39.442
Didn't know shit.

01:06:40.560 --> 01:06:41.820
Just knew I wanted to do something

01:06:41.820 --> 01:06:43.440
that meant something, you know?

01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:46.140
So, I signed up.

01:06:46.140 --> 01:06:48.330
Did four tours.

01:06:48.330 --> 01:06:50.223
Afghanistan, Iraq.

01:06:51.420 --> 01:06:53.133
Found out I was pretty good at it,

01:06:54.510 --> 01:06:58.653
so they signed me up for
this private military thing.

01:07:00.750 --> 01:07:05.610
Pay was better, but
uh, we had to do things

01:07:05.610 --> 01:07:07.500
we weren't supposed to talk about.

01:07:07.500 --> 01:07:08.763
Not publicly anyway.

01:07:09.720 --> 01:07:10.773
That's how I met Ken.

01:07:12.090 --> 01:07:15.423
Felt righteous at first, you know?

01:07:16.950 --> 01:07:21.060
Felt like we were busting
through all the red tape

01:07:21.060 --> 01:07:22.560
and doing the things that we were told

01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:24.240
the politicians didn't have the will

01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:25.530
or even the guts to do, you know,

01:07:25.530 --> 01:07:28.323
to stand up to terror,
to make a difference.

01:07:29.984 --> 01:07:30.817
It was a lot easier

01:07:30.817 --> 01:07:32.583
to see things in black
and white back then.

01:07:33.450 --> 01:07:36.480
Like heroes and villains.

01:07:36.480 --> 01:07:37.590
Good versus evil.

01:07:37.590 --> 01:07:39.960
Black hats. White hats.

01:07:39.960 --> 01:07:41.670
That's probably how that sniper sees it

01:07:41.670 --> 01:07:42.873
over there right now.

01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:45.150
He's probably thinking he's doing

01:07:45.150 --> 01:07:47.553
the right thing for the right reasons.

01:07:49.860 --> 01:07:51.610
That's how I used to see it anyway.

01:07:52.950 --> 01:07:54.180
And now?

01:07:54.180 --> 01:07:55.610
I'm not 18 anymore.

01:07:57.491 --> 01:08:01.023
And it's a lot harder when it's
your ass in the crosshairs.

01:08:06.120 --> 01:08:09.980
Lily's dead, and I may as well be.

01:08:13.290 --> 01:08:14.283
And my daughter,

01:08:17.730 --> 01:08:19.680
who will provide for her once I'm gone?

01:08:22.290 --> 01:08:23.123
I have money.

01:08:24.270 --> 01:08:25.103
I'll get you outta here.

01:08:25.103 --> 01:08:26.466
I'll get you both outta the country.

01:08:26.466 --> 01:08:28.170
We're dead.

01:08:28.170 --> 01:08:29.823
You said so yourself.

01:08:31.620 --> 01:08:33.000
You know what he's thinking.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:34.983
And he knows your every move.

01:08:36.420 --> 01:08:38.280
We're trapped here.

01:08:38.280 --> 01:08:40.537
There's no way out.
- No. No.

01:08:41.520 --> 01:08:42.967
There's a difference.

01:08:43.905 --> 01:08:44.738
What?

01:08:45.717 --> 01:08:47.433
I'm better at this than he is.

01:08:49.434 --> 01:08:52.860
If I can just get to my
rifle, it's over for him.

01:08:52.860 --> 01:08:54.213
And Tamara knows that.

01:08:55.982 --> 01:08:57.482
I just need to get that rifle.

01:08:58.710 --> 01:08:59.730
Give me your hand.

01:09:04.735 --> 01:09:05.568
Why?

01:09:13.500 --> 01:09:16.593
You're a killer and a survivor too.

01:09:18.480 --> 01:09:19.623
A very good one.

01:09:21.180 --> 01:09:22.593
The palms never lie.

01:09:24.240 --> 01:09:28.878
People lie, palms don't.

01:09:40.950 --> 01:09:43.233
This is my daughter, Milena.

01:09:45.540 --> 01:09:47.133
The address is on the back.

01:09:48.060 --> 01:09:51.165
You show her this if I die-

01:09:51.165 --> 01:09:51.998
No, no, no, no!

01:09:51.998 --> 01:09:52.890
You're not gonna die.
- You find her.

01:09:52.890 --> 01:09:55.020
- No!
- And help her.

01:09:55.020 --> 01:09:57.409
Money, school, everything.

01:09:57.409 --> 01:09:58.507
I'm gonna get
you out of this, okay?

01:09:58.507 --> 01:10:00.033
You take her away from here.

01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:01.793
Please.

01:10:04.740 --> 01:10:06.120
I'm gonna, I'm gonna get you outta here.

01:10:06.120 --> 01:10:08.457
You don't need to talk like this.

01:10:08.457 --> 01:10:09.933
You just need to trust me.

01:10:11.910 --> 01:10:13.330
I'm not a trained soldier

01:10:14.340 --> 01:10:15.303
You are.

01:10:17.670 --> 01:10:18.723
And my daughter,

01:10:20.250 --> 01:10:22.263
my daughter cannot survive on her own.

01:10:23.280 --> 01:10:24.213
Understand?

01:10:25.770 --> 01:10:28.200
I help you get your gun.

01:10:28.200 --> 01:10:30.483
You promise to help Milena.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:36.833
Promise.

01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:42.640
Not with words, but with
your heart before God

01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:46.143
and make it real.

01:10:55.981 --> 01:10:57.814
I promise before God

01:11:00.450 --> 01:11:03.050
that I will protect her
with everything that I have.

01:11:06.354 --> 01:11:08.550
But you're gonna see her again.

01:11:08.550 --> 01:11:09.383
Okay?

01:11:10.530 --> 01:11:11.930
We're gonna get out of this.

01:11:23.121 --> 01:11:24.685
Go, go! Move, move!

01:11:33.791 --> 01:11:38.247
I fucking hate snipers.

01:11:55.967 --> 01:11:57.455
If you were a real man,

01:11:57.455 --> 01:11:59.704
you'd look 'em in the
eye when you kill 'em.

01:12:38.738 --> 01:12:40.655
I kill for my Milena.

01:12:47.718 --> 01:12:48.551
No! No!

01:13:08.767 --> 01:13:09.684
Mona. Mona.

01:13:15.661 --> 01:13:18.543
Why did you do that? Why did you do that?

01:13:18.543 --> 01:13:21.626
I told you to run. I told you to run.

01:13:24.701 --> 01:13:26.284
My little Milena.

01:13:27.225 --> 01:13:28.058
What?

01:13:29.370 --> 01:13:31.453
You watch over her now.

01:13:33.854 --> 01:13:35.687
Give her a better life

01:13:38.583 --> 01:13:39.416
than ours.

01:13:41.642 --> 01:13:43.392
Teach her to survive.

01:13:45.292 --> 01:13:46.125
I can't.

01:13:47.755 --> 01:13:48.838
Have faith.

01:13:55.304 --> 01:13:56.971
The palms never lie.

01:14:22.498 --> 01:14:23.680
Ken?

01:14:25.020 --> 01:14:27.211
Jesus Christ, Ken, I
thought you were dead.

01:14:29.397 --> 01:14:30.450
No. No!

01:14:30.450 --> 01:14:31.283
Stop!
- No!

01:14:31.283 --> 01:14:32.116
- Stop!
- No!

01:14:32.116 --> 01:14:33.370
Don't move me, man.

01:14:34.723 --> 01:14:35.556
Don't move me, man.
- Come on, bro.

01:14:35.556 --> 01:14:36.480
We gotta go now.

01:14:36.480 --> 01:14:38.283
No, I can't move my fucking legs!

01:14:41.310 --> 01:14:43.980
Fucker got me through the spine, man.

01:14:43.980 --> 01:14:46.469
Just don't move, fucking move me, man.

01:14:46.469 --> 01:14:47.611
- Okay. Okay.
- I can't move.

01:14:47.611 --> 01:14:49.199
Alright, alright, alright.

01:14:49.199 --> 01:14:50.616
Okay, okay, okay.

01:14:52.020 --> 01:14:53.553
Okay, I got ya.

01:14:56.946 --> 01:14:57.779
Fuck!

01:14:58.680 --> 01:14:59.513
Shit.

01:15:03.360 --> 01:15:05.193
Look at you, bro. Yeah?

01:15:06.300 --> 01:15:08.040
Shatter your spine, they can't get you.

01:15:08.040 --> 01:15:10.020
You're a fucking stud, man.

01:15:10.020 --> 01:15:11.433
Fucking rock star! Yeah?

01:15:13.200 --> 01:15:15.006
It's about time you noticed, man.

01:15:15.006 --> 01:15:15.839
Yeah?

01:15:21.297 --> 01:15:22.130
Okay...

01:15:26.730 --> 01:15:27.963
Sorry about Mona.

01:15:29.670 --> 01:15:30.720
She was a good woman.

01:15:33.326 --> 01:15:34.626
Yeah, she saved my life.

01:15:36.570 --> 01:15:39.040
Yeah, I know.

01:15:40.080 --> 01:15:41.880
Now you have your answer, don't you?

01:15:44.409 --> 01:15:45.259
Answer to what?

01:15:47.670 --> 01:15:48.960
Why someone would give their life

01:15:48.960 --> 01:15:50.960
for some undeserving piece of shit, huh?

01:15:54.090 --> 01:15:55.673
To save someone they love, right?

01:15:56.903 --> 01:16:01.899
Yeah.

01:16:01.899 --> 01:16:04.063
You know what?

01:16:04.063 --> 01:16:05.310
I always knew you'd fall

01:16:05.310 --> 01:16:08.299
for the first hooker you
spend the night with.

01:16:11.101 --> 01:16:12.720
Fuck you. You're lucky
you're a cripple, right.

01:16:12.720 --> 01:16:15.403
Otherwise, I'd beat your
fucking ass for that.

01:16:16.585 --> 01:16:17.439
Fuck!

01:16:17.439 --> 01:16:18.272
Fuck!

01:16:25.142 --> 01:16:26.453
- Take that.
- No, no, man.

01:16:26.453 --> 01:16:27.657
- We're moving.
- Fucking go without me.

01:16:27.657 --> 01:16:28.740
- No. No.
- Just go.

01:16:28.740 --> 01:16:29.573
I'm not leaving you here.

01:16:29.573 --> 01:16:30.750
Do you understand me?

01:16:30.750 --> 01:16:32.493
I'm not fucking leaving you here!

01:16:33.600 --> 01:16:35.850
The elevator, the lobby, the stairs,

01:16:35.850 --> 01:16:37.590
all of it will be crawling
with armed assholes.

01:16:37.590 --> 01:16:39.321
Just fucking go, man!

01:16:39.321 --> 01:16:41.061
That's why we're gonna
fortify our position.

01:16:41.061 --> 01:16:41.894
No, no!

01:16:41.894 --> 01:16:42.727
Just shut up-

01:16:44.802 --> 01:16:46.200
We both know I'm dead already.

01:16:46.200 --> 01:16:49.305
And if I can't get a hard
on, I might as well be.

01:16:52.132 --> 01:16:52.965
Fuck!

01:17:00.160 --> 01:17:03.900
The good news is, you were
right about these sheets.

01:17:03.900 --> 01:17:04.950
Real silk.

01:17:04.950 --> 01:17:05.910
What? Beirut again?

01:17:05.910 --> 01:17:06.990
You fucking kidding me?

01:17:06.990 --> 01:17:09.000
Would you just have a little faith?

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.340
Faith? No, it's not gonna work.

01:17:11.340 --> 01:17:12.173
No!

01:17:19.341 --> 01:17:20.640
It's Tamara.

01:17:20.640 --> 01:17:21.840
She's behind this.

01:17:21.840 --> 01:17:22.673
I know, I know.

01:17:22.673 --> 01:17:23.506
You know?

01:17:25.260 --> 01:17:28.200
That's why I was so
heated at you retiring.

01:17:28.200 --> 01:17:30.810
I had a hunch that bitch
was gonna pull something.

01:17:30.810 --> 01:17:31.860
Answer it. Answer it.

01:17:33.810 --> 01:17:37.320
Hey Tam, you still hiring?

01:17:37.320 --> 01:17:39.300
Looks like you could use a new team.

01:17:39.300 --> 01:17:40.920
Ken, you're still alive.

01:17:40.920 --> 01:17:44.229
You're worse than a cockroach
and just as hard to kill.

01:17:44.229 --> 01:17:45.270
But not impossible.

01:17:45.270 --> 01:17:47.508
You're such a cunt.

01:17:47.508 --> 01:17:51.090
Well,
congratulations, gentlemen.

01:17:51.090 --> 01:17:52.293
You've just levelled up.

01:17:53.333 --> 01:17:55.110
What the fuck are you talking about?

01:17:55.110 --> 01:17:55.943
Shit.

01:17:55.943 --> 01:17:57.300
Yes, shit.

01:17:57.300 --> 01:17:58.920
Deep fucking shit.

01:17:58.920 --> 01:18:00.780
I have clearance from up top.

01:18:00.780 --> 01:18:04.290
You two are now high priority targets.

01:18:04.290 --> 01:18:06.988
You got to get out of here right now.

01:18:06.988 --> 01:18:08.803
Go!

01:18:10.832 --> 01:18:12.984
That better not be what I think it is.

01:18:12.984 --> 01:18:16.290
Oh, yes it is.

01:18:16.290 --> 01:18:17.123
Go! Run!

01:18:17.994 --> 01:18:19.472
Now!
- I'll draw his fire.

01:18:45.321 --> 01:18:46.154
Fuck.

01:19:34.640 --> 01:19:37.473
Fuck you!

01:19:41.981 --> 01:19:43.398
Let's go. Move!

01:19:45.643 --> 01:19:47.490
All right, drone's down.

01:19:47.490 --> 01:19:48.373
Took care of it.

01:19:50.985 --> 01:19:51.818
Ken? Ken?

01:20:26.527 --> 01:20:27.360
Ah, shit.

01:20:35.167 --> 01:20:36.500
Okay, Ken. Okay.

01:20:38.474 --> 01:20:41.057
I'm in your hands now, brother.

01:20:45.684 --> 01:20:48.197
Okay, let's go.

01:20:48.197 --> 01:20:49.768
Oh, shit!

01:20:52.423 --> 01:20:55.811
Yeah!

01:20:55.811 --> 01:20:59.012
Whoo, yeah!

01:20:59.012 --> 01:21:01.262
It worked, baby. It worked!

01:21:02.283 --> 01:21:03.866
Beirut, baby. Yeah.

01:21:05.433 --> 01:21:06.810
Whoo!

01:21:06.810 --> 01:21:08.992
You're a fucking legend.

01:21:15.795 --> 01:21:16.920
Holy shit!

01:21:21.462 --> 01:21:25.045
Okay, verification
received loud and clear.

01:21:27.041 --> 01:21:28.291
Thank you, God.

01:21:57.857 --> 01:22:01.380
Samuel Carter Lorde,
as I live and breathe.

01:22:01.380 --> 01:22:03.232
How the hell are you?

01:22:03.232 --> 01:22:04.289
Oh. I'm fine.

01:22:04.289 --> 01:22:06.393
No thanks to you, Tamara Lucille Wright.

01:22:07.449 --> 01:22:08.417
Where are ya?

01:22:08.417 --> 01:22:09.623
Wouldn't you like to know?

01:22:09.623 --> 01:22:11.043
Yeah, I would actually.

01:22:11.910 --> 01:22:14.550
Um, although I'm guessing

01:22:14.550 --> 01:22:16.140
shit must have been hitting all manner

01:22:16.140 --> 01:22:17.820
and sizes of fans at the office.

01:22:17.820 --> 01:22:18.870
How did you make it out?

01:22:18.870 --> 01:22:20.470
It was time to move on anyway.

01:22:22.477 --> 01:22:23.310
Mm.

01:22:26.610 --> 01:22:28.860
I'm a survivor, Sam.

01:22:28.860 --> 01:22:32.190
I have a valued skill
set, and I'm no liability,

01:22:32.190 --> 01:22:35.133
so I'll find something fun to do.

01:22:36.300 --> 01:22:37.133
How about you?

01:22:38.029 --> 01:22:38.862
I guess you could say

01:22:38.862 --> 01:22:42.510
I've found my true religion in a sense.

01:22:42.510 --> 01:22:43.560
You've gone all Jesusy.

01:22:43.560 --> 01:22:45.330
I would never have guessed that from you.

01:22:45.330 --> 01:22:47.910
Nah, not Jesus, although I've
got nothing against the guy.

01:22:47.910 --> 01:22:52.020
But no for me, it's, uh
more about karma these days.

01:22:52.020 --> 01:22:55.413
More specifically, karmic retribution.

01:22:56.310 --> 01:22:57.270
See, I gotta make the world

01:22:57.270 --> 01:23:00.090
a better place for the
next generation, Tam.

01:23:00.090 --> 01:23:01.473
Rediscovered my faith.

01:23:02.370 --> 01:23:04.500
But you're still shooting, though.

01:23:04.500 --> 01:23:06.810
So it's the same song,
just a different band.

01:23:06.810 --> 01:23:09.780
No, I don't work for anyone anymore.

01:23:09.780 --> 01:23:10.773
It's just me now.

01:23:11.939 --> 01:23:13.260
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

01:23:13.260 --> 01:23:14.520
Ma'am, we need to go.

01:23:14.520 --> 01:23:16.167
And there is much to atone for.

01:23:16.167 --> 01:23:18.240
But no sniping now either.

01:23:18.240 --> 01:23:21.870
No, if I'm gonna do
some killing these days,

01:23:21.870 --> 01:23:23.640
it's gonna be up close and personal.

01:23:23.640 --> 01:23:25.453
You know, look them in the eye.

01:23:25.453 --> 01:23:26.730
I mean, if something's worth doing,

01:23:26.730 --> 01:23:29.820
it's worth getting your
hands dirty for, right?

01:23:29.820 --> 01:23:30.653
Although that's something

01:23:30.653 --> 01:23:33.052
you never really understood, is it Tam?

01:23:33.052 --> 01:23:33.885
Look, no, do you know

01:23:33.885 --> 01:23:35.040
what you never understood?

01:23:35.040 --> 01:23:36.720
Is that the real art is
not getting dirty at all.

01:23:36.720 --> 01:23:38.340
We'll see if you feel the same way

01:23:38.340 --> 01:23:39.480
when you see me in person.

01:23:39.480 --> 01:23:40.740
Oh, Sam, by this time tomorrow,

01:23:40.740 --> 01:23:43.320
I'm gonna be working for
some billionaire in Dubai.

01:23:43.320 --> 01:23:44.153
You're not gonna get

01:23:44.153 --> 01:23:46.020
within 1,000 miles of me.

01:23:46.020 --> 01:23:47.070
That's really disappointing.

01:23:47.070 --> 01:23:48.240
Well, get used to it.

01:23:48.240 --> 01:23:49.260
You're a dead man walking.

01:23:49.260 --> 01:23:50.307
And you're on your own.

01:23:50.307 --> 01:23:52.560
No, I'm not alone anymore.

01:23:52.560 --> 01:23:55.770
No. I got responsibilities now.

01:23:55.770 --> 01:23:56.670
But that doesn't matter.

01:23:56.670 --> 01:23:58.590
Tam, one more thing.

01:23:58.590 --> 01:24:00.026
What's that?

01:24:00.026 --> 01:24:01.237
You believe in God?

01:24:01.237 --> 01:24:04.830
Good one.

01:24:04.830 --> 01:24:06.420
Well, you know what they say.

01:24:06.420 --> 01:24:07.833
Verify, then trust.

01:24:09.090 --> 01:24:12.270
I am a long way from verifying that.

01:24:12.270 --> 01:24:13.380
You know what, Tam,

01:24:13.380 --> 01:24:15.725
you may be closer than you think.

01:24:15.725 --> 01:24:17.733
This is boring now, Sam. Goodbye.

01:24:52.300 --> 01:24:53.133
Come on.

01:25:01.289 --> 01:25:02.539
