01:24.375 --> 01:26.833
There are a lot of things
happening in this life.

01:40.125 --> 01:43.083
Sometimes, it exceeds
what a person can handle.

01:45.541 --> 01:47.291
At least, that's how you may think...

01:51.333 --> 01:52.916
until it really happens.

01:58.958 --> 02:01.208
And you still stand strong.

02:33.750 --> 02:35.083
I didn't want to wake you.

02:42.375 --> 02:44.458
Voke, what about the money?

02:51.916 --> 02:52.833
I'll get it today.

03:05.291 --> 03:08.041
If you knew you couldn't get the money,
you should've told me.

03:08.125 --> 03:11.208
-I wouldn't have spent what I came with.
-I'll get it today.

03:11.291 --> 03:12.833
Now, you don't have a choice.

03:27.416 --> 03:28.541
It was an accident.

03:30.750 --> 03:31.791
Voke.

03:36.208 --> 03:37.083
Voke.

03:39.375 --> 03:41.250
-Voke, you know I'm not--
-Hey, Som, Som.

03:43.041 --> 03:44.125
Daddy V.

03:44.875 --> 03:45.958
Lolu.

04:00.458 --> 04:01.458
Good morning.

04:43.500 --> 04:44.833
You're lucky I love you.

04:44.916 --> 04:46.250
I love you so much.

04:57.958 --> 04:59.166
Let me eat, too.

05:11.166 --> 05:12.625
Has Chisom asked for that money?

05:16.083 --> 05:17.208
She was angry.

05:20.916 --> 05:22.833
But it's not a problem. I'll get it today.

05:24.083 --> 05:26.500
Bro, I know you don't like
these sort of things.

05:26.583 --> 05:28.416
But I really appreciate it.

05:32.666 --> 05:34.833
I promised you I would take care of her.

05:35.875 --> 05:37.875
I held her in my arms when she was born.

05:38.791 --> 05:40.125
That's my child.

05:42.208 --> 05:43.208
Don't worry about it.

05:45.208 --> 05:46.458
You're family.

05:57.291 --> 06:00.041
Get out of here!
Later you'll be acting all tough.

06:00.125 --> 06:01.458
I know you too well.

06:07.708 --> 06:08.583
Think about it.

06:11.041 --> 06:12.708
-It's a school bus!
-You're having fun!

06:12.791 --> 06:13.875
Which school bus?

06:14.666 --> 06:15.833
All right. We're done.

06:16.583 --> 06:19.166
If the police arrest you, don't call me.

06:19.250 --> 06:20.291
I can't help you.

06:20.375 --> 06:21.583
Okay? You're on your own.

06:21.666 --> 06:22.833
Vovo, my friend.

06:23.666 --> 06:26.166
-Vovo! What's up?
-Hey.

06:26.875 --> 06:27.750
Boss Rogba.

06:27.833 --> 06:29.333
-Bro, how are you doing?
-Well done.

06:29.416 --> 06:30.708
-Please come.
-You should go.

06:30.791 --> 06:32.791
I've been looking for you.
Where have you been?

06:33.958 --> 06:35.041
Any good news?

06:35.125 --> 06:37.208
It was exactly as you mentioned.

06:37.708 --> 06:39.958
The girl stole the money.
She hid it in her buttocks.

06:40.041 --> 06:41.250
We were all surprised.

06:45.333 --> 06:46.416
I'll meet you up ahead.

06:46.500 --> 06:49.291
-Don't you realize a child is here?
-Don't be angry. Fine girl.

06:49.375 --> 06:51.166
-Daddy V.
-I'm coming.

06:54.958 --> 06:57.291
I said it that day,
but the guy disregarded me.

06:57.375 --> 06:58.416
Don't mind him.

06:58.500 --> 06:59.916
Anyway, he's blinded by love.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.583
I billed him 150,000.

07:02.333 --> 07:03.791
My cut is 50,000. Is that okay?

07:04.708 --> 07:06.458
-Today?
-I'm going to meet him now.

07:08.250 --> 07:09.625
-That's good.
-I got you.

07:09.708 --> 07:10.750
Vovo, my friend.

07:10.833 --> 07:12.833
You have no idea
what you've just done for me.

07:12.916 --> 07:14.041
I'm here for you, Vovo!

07:14.125 --> 07:16.625
-Did you hear what happened to Wasiu?
-Which Wasiu?

07:19.750 --> 07:22.625
-Why are you frowning?
-I want ice cream.

07:22.708 --> 07:25.041
Wasn't it you who fed us this morning?

07:25.125 --> 07:27.041
I didn't want to eat that.

07:35.166 --> 07:37.875
Oh my God! Help me, Daddy!

07:37.958 --> 07:39.416
Daddy V!

07:40.833 --> 07:41.791
Leave my child alone.

07:44.250 --> 07:45.958
-Let me go!
-I said leave my child alone!

07:46.416 --> 07:48.208
-Daddy, please! Daddy!
-Let her go!

07:48.291 --> 07:50.416
Are you crazy? I said let my child go!

07:51.291 --> 07:52.791
-Who are you?
-Leave me alone!

07:52.875 --> 07:55.750
Help me, Daddy! Daddy V!

07:55.833 --> 07:57.833
-Daddy V, help me! Leave me alone!
-Oh boy.

07:57.916 --> 07:59.041
Daddy V!

08:21.416 --> 08:22.416
So, who is crazy now?

08:36.250 --> 08:37.708
-I'll go after him.
-Go!

09:09.416 --> 09:10.666
Help me!

09:17.375 --> 09:18.375
Help me!

09:18.458 --> 09:19.833
-Daddy!
-Lolu!

09:25.000 --> 09:25.875
Lolu!

09:37.625 --> 09:38.916
Lolu!

09:45.958 --> 09:47.375
Somebody should help me!

10:59.000 --> 10:59.833
Daddy!

11:02.333 --> 11:04.166
-Daddy!
-Lolu!

11:04.250 --> 11:05.958
Lolu! Lolu!

11:33.375 --> 11:34.375
Where is Lolu?

11:38.916 --> 11:41.250
Don't worry. This one will tell us.

11:58.625 --> 12:00.166
Where did you take my child?

12:00.791 --> 12:02.416
Where did you take my child?

12:05.666 --> 12:06.708
You don't learn.

12:47.875 --> 12:50.000
Where did you take my child?

13:05.083 --> 13:06.083
Bro, please!

13:07.541 --> 13:08.541
What did you say?

13:09.083 --> 13:10.291
Bro, please!

13:10.375 --> 13:11.583
Did you say "please"?

13:12.750 --> 13:15.583
Where did you take my child?

13:24.166 --> 13:26.333
Bro, I swear!
I don't know where they took her to.

13:30.833 --> 13:35.541
If you don't tell me where my child is,
then, don't tell me anything.

13:35.625 --> 13:36.875
Do you hear me?

13:44.166 --> 13:46.125
I only urinated on three.

13:53.708 --> 13:55.458
Calm down. That's enough.

13:58.541 --> 13:59.791
Chill!

14:00.666 --> 14:01.916
That's enough.

14:08.916 --> 14:10.083
Voke, what do we do now?

14:13.916 --> 14:15.333
I need to go see my mother.

14:17.208 --> 14:20.083
My mother can tell us where Lolu might be.

14:20.166 --> 14:21.708
Are you sure she would agree?

14:22.416 --> 14:24.625
That's the only thing we can do right now.

14:25.708 --> 14:26.958
Once I find the location,

14:28.083 --> 14:29.125
I will call you.

14:29.666 --> 14:31.166
-Voke.
-Hey. Hey.

14:33.333 --> 14:34.833
We will find Lolu.

14:35.375 --> 14:36.625
Don't worry about it.

14:37.208 --> 14:39.458
Okay, I will be back.

15:19.833 --> 15:20.833
Good day, Ma.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.083
Voke!

15:28.041 --> 15:29.125
How are you?

15:42.750 --> 15:44.958
-They will come and sweep it now.
-Sweep what?

15:51.791 --> 15:53.458
Didn't I tell you it would break?

15:54.625 --> 15:55.916
-Funke!
-Ma'am!

15:57.291 --> 15:59.458
Bring something to clean this mess.

15:59.541 --> 16:00.625
Okay, Ma'am.

16:07.541 --> 16:08.875
Look how lean you are.

16:10.375 --> 16:12.791
Look at you. You have blood everywhere.

16:12.875 --> 16:15.125
-What's the problem?
-My friend's child...

16:15.708 --> 16:17.416
The girl who is my goddaughter.

16:18.791 --> 16:19.875
She was kidnapped.

16:23.625 --> 16:25.208
-Funke!
-Ma'am!

16:25.291 --> 16:27.000
Please bring some fufu for my child.

16:27.083 --> 16:29.458
-Okay, ma'am
-Do you want banga or owo?

16:30.333 --> 16:33.458
No, Mom, please.
Let's forget about food for now.

16:33.541 --> 16:36.250
Forget about food now.
I don't have time. Please!

16:36.333 --> 16:40.000
What do you mean "forget about food"?
When did you last eat in this house?

16:41.541 --> 16:43.125
-Mama, please,
-What's wrong with you?

16:44.041 --> 16:46.416
-Just help me check--
-If this is why you are here,

16:49.166 --> 16:50.416
the answer is no!

16:50.500 --> 16:51.833
N-O!

16:53.000 --> 16:54.875
-Mama.
-Look at what happened to your father!

16:57.416 --> 16:58.583
Please.

16:59.083 --> 17:01.291
Help me.
It won't take you more than two minutes.

17:01.375 --> 17:04.000
Voke, you'll have to push me inside
and make me do it!

17:04.541 --> 17:05.791
Should I go do it myself?

17:05.875 --> 17:07.458
Voke, don't push me!

17:09.208 --> 17:10.208
I'm warning you.

17:10.291 --> 17:12.166
Do you want them
to take something from you?

17:12.250 --> 17:13.958
If they want to, let them take it.

17:14.041 --> 17:15.833
-This girl is my child.
-She is not!

17:17.208 --> 17:19.791
How can you claim
someone's child as yours, Voke?

17:21.291 --> 17:23.083
Get married and have your own child!

17:23.166 --> 17:24.333
Birth your own!

17:30.750 --> 17:31.791
What is it?

17:34.500 --> 17:35.666
Your father is calling you.

17:37.666 --> 17:40.833
Father, the strongest
when it comes to black magic.

17:41.375 --> 17:44.500
In this family,
we all had natural gifts,

17:44.625 --> 17:46.291
but black magic is complex.

17:54.791 --> 17:56.000
Just like Father,

17:56.083 --> 17:58.875
who used the travelling powers
to save Mama.

17:58.958 --> 18:00.416
Papa!

18:04.916 --> 18:06.125
Good day.

18:08.166 --> 18:09.541
It's been a long time.

18:11.916 --> 18:13.000
How are you doing?

18:14.500 --> 18:17.125
What happened, Voke?

18:19.750 --> 18:22.208
I can't hear you.

18:22.291 --> 18:24.083
What happened, Voke?

18:24.166 --> 18:26.083
I can't hear what you're saying.

18:31.166 --> 18:32.458
He's asking what happened.

18:39.208 --> 18:41.250
They kidnapped my friend's child.

18:42.416 --> 18:43.416
Lolu.

18:45.208 --> 18:47.000
I want Mama to help me find her.

18:47.083 --> 18:51.083
And I told him that
we don't do those kind of things here.

18:51.166 --> 18:52.916
Mama, why are you saying that?

18:53.458 --> 18:56.291
Imagine if it was me.
You have a child, too.

18:56.416 --> 18:58.083
Imagine if it's me, if it's your child.

18:58.166 --> 18:59.125
You have a child, too.

18:59.208 --> 19:00.416
What's wrong with you?

19:01.916 --> 19:03.625
Why did you bring this matter here?

19:04.583 --> 19:06.125
Did you see your father? Voke!

19:06.208 --> 19:08.666
If I don't bring the matter here,
where else can I go?

19:08.750 --> 19:10.291
Why did you bring this matter here?

19:10.833 --> 19:13.083
If I don't bring the matter here,
where else can I go?

19:38.000 --> 19:39.125
Ede, are you sure?

19:48.166 --> 19:50.000
You're lucky that your father is here.

19:57.166 --> 19:58.333
Thank you, sir.

21:22.958 --> 21:24.166
Why did you stop?

21:33.625 --> 21:36.250
I can't pinpoint the girl's location.

21:36.833 --> 21:37.750
Why?

21:39.375 --> 21:41.000
Something is blocking my vision.

21:41.083 --> 21:43.250
Something more powerful than you?

21:45.458 --> 21:47.416
-Is that right?
-Voke.

21:48.666 --> 21:50.250
This girl is in serious trouble.

21:51.250 --> 21:52.625
If you don't find her soon...

21:57.500 --> 21:59.208
Okay, Mama, I'm leaving.

21:59.291 --> 22:00.333
Voke.

22:01.666 --> 22:02.791
You're my only child.

22:12.583 --> 22:13.625
Thank you.

22:17.291 --> 22:18.375
You're welcome.

22:21.500 --> 22:22.666
Rogba!

22:27.166 --> 22:29.333
I've been trying to reach you,
but to no avail.

22:29.875 --> 22:33.916
Listen, I can't bear it anymore.
I'm off to the mountains to clear my head.

22:34.000 --> 22:36.375
I don't know
if I can keep going without Lolu.

22:36.458 --> 22:40.541
And since you are not answering,
I fear the worst has happened.

22:51.458 --> 22:52.333
Bro...

22:55.375 --> 22:57.500
I've been calling you. What's going on?

23:02.083 --> 23:03.375
I told you to wait for me.

23:03.916 --> 23:05.416
Give it to me.

23:05.500 --> 23:06.458
Give it to me!

23:09.666 --> 23:14.083
Mother didn't see the exact location,
but, I know she's still within the area.

23:14.666 --> 23:15.875
We will find her.

23:19.666 --> 23:23.958
Rogba! Rogba!

23:44.666 --> 23:47.041
-Bro, please! Please!
-Who sent you?

23:47.125 --> 23:48.500
Who is the person who sent you?

23:48.583 --> 23:50.625
A guy showed me his picture,
told me to kill him.

23:50.708 --> 23:52.416
Which guy? Who told you to do that?

23:52.500 --> 23:55.041
Bro, please!
They just gave me money to kill him.

23:55.500 --> 23:56.458
Please, bro!

24:06.500 --> 24:07.625
Rogba.

24:14.583 --> 24:18.000
What are you doing?
What are your boys doing?

24:18.083 --> 24:19.625
That's not where I pointed.

24:20.583 --> 24:21.708
Tell them to move.

24:21.791 --> 24:22.708
Please calm down.

24:22.791 --> 24:24.916
That's not where I pointed. He fell here.

24:25.333 --> 24:27.666
It's here! Tell them to move!

24:30.750 --> 24:32.625
We will find him.

24:36.875 --> 24:38.416
Move to that side!

24:39.791 --> 24:41.833
Move fast! Keep moving!

24:42.833 --> 24:45.333
Bro, it's not been long since he fell.

24:45.416 --> 24:47.250
He just fell a moment ago.

24:47.333 --> 24:49.250
It was right here! He fell right here.

24:49.666 --> 24:51.250
Ask them to search that area, please.

24:51.333 --> 24:52.416
Well done!

24:53.375 --> 24:56.125
Check that side.

25:00.333 --> 25:01.291
Gbenga!

25:02.125 --> 25:04.041
I just received some information.

25:04.583 --> 25:07.625
They found a body at the morgue,
a young girl in uniform.

25:08.833 --> 25:10.041
It's probably Lolu.

25:12.791 --> 25:14.541
Are they sure it's her?

25:14.625 --> 25:15.875
You have to come immediately.

25:15.958 --> 25:18.791
They will dispose of the body,
if you don't confirm that it's her.

25:21.208 --> 25:22.291
Please hurry!

25:27.875 --> 25:30.250
-Have they seen him?
-They are still searching.

25:30.333 --> 25:32.041
Please give me your phone number.

25:34.291 --> 25:39.041
If you find him,
take him to the nearest hospital.

25:39.125 --> 25:41.375
-Okay.
-I will call you. Hold on to this.

25:41.458 --> 25:42.541
-Okay.
-Well done.

25:51.958 --> 25:55.166
They found a body at the morgue...

26:22.666 --> 26:23.708
Take it easy.

26:34.125 --> 26:36.250
That's how they were
when they brought her here.

26:43.875 --> 26:44.791
Are you okay?

27:02.916 --> 27:05.291
I had forgotten that I met Chisom.

27:06.750 --> 27:08.541
She gave me this message for you.

27:13.958 --> 27:15.041
Take it easy, please.

27:39.666 --> 27:40.958
But I must go.

27:45.791 --> 27:49.041
Bro, we have searched everywhere.

27:49.708 --> 27:52.666
We've searched everywhere
but we couldn't find him.

27:54.041 --> 27:56.208
But he fell into the water.

27:59.000 --> 28:00.750
Are you sure you've searched thoroughly?

28:05.083 --> 28:07.041
Or does the water carry people elsewhere?

28:11.458 --> 28:12.666
Something like that.

28:12.750 --> 28:14.750
Because there's a place over there that--

28:14.833 --> 28:16.708
-That's true. Over there.
-Yes, over there.

28:16.791 --> 28:19.291
-It can--
-Listen. Please keep searching.

28:20.666 --> 28:22.708
He is in the water. I'm very sure of it.

29:02.000 --> 29:03.208
Mother.

29:16.958 --> 29:18.375
When I touched her body,

29:20.000 --> 29:21.125
I felt it.

29:23.458 --> 29:25.000
I felt it on my hands.

29:25.958 --> 29:27.833
It rushed into my body.

29:30.166 --> 29:31.500
I saw it.

29:32.208 --> 29:33.416
I saw the weapon.

29:34.000 --> 29:35.833
Do you still have your other powers?

29:35.916 --> 29:36.916
Yes, I do.

29:37.416 --> 29:38.416
Voke!

29:39.750 --> 29:43.250
I've never seen anyone
with more than two powers before,

29:45.416 --> 29:46.541
but you.

29:47.166 --> 29:48.416
You have three.

29:52.416 --> 29:53.875
Nothing will happen to me.

30:13.000 --> 30:13.916
This is the knife!

30:15.291 --> 30:16.666
That's the knife,

30:17.666 --> 30:19.583
they killed Lolu with.

30:19.666 --> 30:20.500
Voke.

30:22.500 --> 30:23.666
Leave it alone.

30:24.875 --> 30:27.083
The thing behind this is too strong,

30:28.500 --> 30:29.500
even for me.

30:30.375 --> 30:32.500
I tried to use my power,

30:32.583 --> 30:36.333
but it was blocking my vision.

30:36.416 --> 30:37.250
Voke!

30:38.208 --> 30:39.208
Please!

30:40.375 --> 30:41.458
Mother.

30:43.708 --> 30:45.041
This is my fight.

30:47.250 --> 30:48.208
Don't worry.

30:50.291 --> 30:51.541
But I promise you

30:54.000 --> 30:55.333
I will handle it with caution.

30:55.875 --> 30:57.041
Voke.

31:17.166 --> 31:18.291
Obatere...

31:18.791 --> 31:21.166
I warned you before,

31:21.250 --> 31:23.500
but you didn't listen.

31:24.166 --> 31:26.166
I know I've put him in danger, Edere.

31:26.250 --> 31:27.500
The boy will be okay...

31:28.583 --> 31:29.500
for now.

31:29.583 --> 31:33.000
You would've known
if he isn't going to be okay.

32:09.416 --> 32:12.041
Vovo, what's up? Are you here?
Okay, I can hear the music.

32:12.125 --> 32:14.875
You'll see a staircase,
take the turn, and come that way.

32:14.958 --> 32:17.500
You're pretending you don't want to come,
but you like money.

32:17.583 --> 32:20.583
My friend, I know
there's booty everywhere, but focus.

32:20.666 --> 32:22.875
Have you climbed the staircase?
Keep going!

32:22.958 --> 32:24.625
You'll see a door when you get upstairs.

32:25.291 --> 32:27.541
Bro, answer me,
I feel like I'm talking to myself.

32:27.625 --> 32:30.416
There's a door by that staircase.
Keep going straight.

32:30.500 --> 32:32.583
Don't look at the women. We're inside.

32:50.333 --> 32:54.250
-Mr...
-Voke, but you can call him Vovo.

33:12.500 --> 33:13.791
That's the gist of it.

34:21.791 --> 34:24.416
-How much does the XO cost in this club?
-400,000.

34:25.625 --> 34:26.708
What about the fake one?

34:27.583 --> 34:28.583
Are you kidding?

34:29.791 --> 34:31.833
Peter, stop. Stop there.

34:33.291 --> 34:34.250
Stop what?

34:36.291 --> 34:37.291
What is happening?

34:37.375 --> 34:38.625
Nonsense. No money for you.

34:38.708 --> 34:41.166
Dude! Don't touch me.
Don't you dare touch me!

34:41.250 --> 34:42.833
-No money for you.
-Are you joking?

34:42.916 --> 34:44.625
-What do you mean?
-No money.

34:45.250 --> 34:46.541
Nothing for you.

34:46.625 --> 34:49.541
So you think you can come here,
and mess me over.

34:49.625 --> 34:51.833
I got no time for that.
Give me my money. I'll leave!

34:51.916 --> 34:53.875
You think you can challenge me in my club?

34:53.958 --> 34:56.291
I will kill you here
and nothing will happen.

34:56.375 --> 34:58.791
-The gun isn't going to do it.
-Nothing will happen here.

35:09.583 --> 35:10.750
Vovo!

35:44.125 --> 35:44.958
Go, Voke.

36:00.333 --> 36:02.250
Look at you. Look at your face.

36:03.125 --> 36:04.541
How dare you touch me?

36:05.208 --> 36:06.541
My friend, I'm so proud of you.

36:06.625 --> 36:08.416
Let me shower you with this money.

36:08.500 --> 36:09.833
Okay, take it.

36:19.208 --> 36:20.875
Never bring me to this kind of place.

36:23.000 --> 36:24.333
Are you crazy?

36:26.291 --> 36:27.208
Vovo!

37:05.250 --> 37:07.375
-Be careful.
-No, I will follow you.

37:07.458 --> 37:10.166
Voke will leave.
It will just be me and you in this house.

37:12.208 --> 37:15.333
Okay, pity him a little.
Just give him a small hug.

37:16.458 --> 37:18.291
He is pretending. Come back here.

37:30.916 --> 37:31.958
McAnthony.

37:33.041 --> 37:34.083
How are you doing?

37:35.250 --> 37:37.791
Crazy man! Don't you sleep at home?

37:40.083 --> 37:41.250
Vovo, my friend.

37:41.333 --> 37:42.625
Answer me.

37:43.875 --> 37:46.208
I've been thinking about our job
at the club yesterday.

37:46.291 --> 37:47.625
It was like an action movie.

37:47.708 --> 37:51.416
You really messed those local villains up.

37:52.041 --> 37:54.708
Did you not see what
a useless job you took me to do?

37:54.791 --> 37:57.375
I've told you not to take me
to these kind of useless jobs.

37:57.458 --> 38:00.000
It's an occupational hazard.
It happens from time to time.

38:00.083 --> 38:01.208
Do you understand?

38:02.833 --> 38:05.333
I'm thinking we should resume work.
Do you understand?

38:05.416 --> 38:06.791
It will help you to...

38:07.250 --> 38:10.333
Compart... Compartmenta...
What am I trying to say?

38:11.416 --> 38:13.541
It will help you forget and focus.
You get it?

38:13.625 --> 38:14.666
A healthy distraction.

38:14.750 --> 38:17.208
As long as it's a good job, I'm with you.

38:17.291 --> 38:18.958
Have I ever disappointed you before?

38:19.041 --> 38:21.000
What was it that you did yesterday?

38:22.625 --> 38:24.625
-Vovo!
-Leave me alone.

38:27.458 --> 38:28.541
Volcano!

38:40.666 --> 38:41.875
Boss P.

38:42.958 --> 38:43.958
Gbengus!

38:44.083 --> 38:46.333
-I'm okay. How are you?
-Hello, fine girl.

38:47.083 --> 38:48.250
How are you?

38:48.333 --> 38:49.833
Boss P, this is the guy.

38:51.791 --> 38:53.916
-How are you doing?
-Very well.

38:55.666 --> 38:59.541
Well, the boss is around, but you guys
should go wait for him over there.

39:06.000 --> 39:07.250
You're lucky I love you.

39:07.333 --> 39:08.583
I love you so much.

39:28.916 --> 39:31.750
Did they kill the guy here?

39:31.833 --> 39:33.125
Gbamsolutely.

39:33.916 --> 39:35.708
Kayode died in his office.

39:36.708 --> 39:37.916
Let me see the office.

39:39.000 --> 39:40.083
Boss P, don't be upset.

39:40.166 --> 39:42.333
He has his own method and process. Okay?

39:42.416 --> 39:43.458
He follows due process.

39:48.500 --> 39:50.416
Bro, calm down. Relax.

39:51.000 --> 39:52.250
Fine girl.

40:04.541 --> 40:08.166
Pius, make sure you are done
before the boss comes back, please.

40:08.250 --> 40:09.958
-Be careful, please.
-No problem.

40:10.041 --> 40:11.666
-Thank you.
-Gbengus.

40:11.750 --> 40:14.958
-Let's go.
-Go on in. Quickly.

40:22.375 --> 40:24.500
How can someone
be murdered in such a place?

40:28.333 --> 40:30.125
That's what we want to find out.

40:56.500 --> 40:57.791
The big boss is here.

40:58.625 --> 41:00.166
Voke, let's go, please.

41:01.625 --> 41:02.750
Wait? Are you joking?

41:02.833 --> 41:04.250
Bro, let's go, please.

41:07.041 --> 41:08.208
Pius!

41:09.333 --> 41:11.666
This is the man I told you about.

41:11.750 --> 41:16.833
He said he wants to personally
see where Mr. Kayode was murdered.

41:19.208 --> 41:20.125
Sorry, sir.

41:32.333 --> 41:33.500
There's black magic here.

41:42.250 --> 41:45.541
Over time, I honed my gifts.

41:46.791 --> 41:48.541
I can sense black magic by touch.

41:49.625 --> 41:51.416
A glimpse of what has transpired.

41:52.416 --> 41:56.541
But for ordinary eyes,
I infuse the Obsidian rock.

41:57.333 --> 41:59.166
This gives a glimpse of black magic.

42:13.083 --> 42:15.708
Nobody knew something
was taken from that body...

43:41.416 --> 43:42.625
What did you see?

45:02.750 --> 45:04.458
Let me fuck them up big time.

45:04.541 --> 45:05.708
In return.

45:14.583 --> 45:16.250
there's black magic here.

45:18.458 --> 45:19.583
An organ was taken.

45:28.125 --> 45:32.625
There were five targets.

46:30.083 --> 46:33.500
If it's money, money is not a problem.

47:07.250 --> 47:08.458
Who was in it?

47:12.791 --> 47:14.291
Mr. Tony.

47:14.375 --> 47:15.291
Mr. Kayode.

47:16.583 --> 47:18.333
-Owen Ugbe.
-Diana Ikeji.

47:18.416 --> 47:19.666
Mr. Edere Boloko.

48:25.833 --> 48:28.708
That's not true, man.
I left to focus on my music.

48:36.833 --> 48:39.625
Are you all crazy?

50:04.875 --> 50:05.958
Leke.

50:54.458 --> 50:55.416
Leke.

50:59.000 --> 51:00.708
My popsy's sweat, right?

51:03.958 --> 51:04.875
They will find out!

52:28.208 --> 52:29.708
Who are you?

52:36.250 --> 52:37.250
Lola!

52:40.083 --> 52:41.166
Do you know this man?

53:08.666 --> 53:11.458
-Bro, your knife is really sharp.
-What do you expect?

54:19.708 --> 54:21.208
I deserve to know what happened.

54:45.416 --> 54:47.458
You haven't changed.

54:47.541 --> 54:49.000
The street runs in your veins.

54:50.625 --> 54:53.875
Of course!
Remember, you used to bring me here a lot.

54:57.375 --> 54:59.125
Please. I can't use my bare hands.

55:04.875 --> 55:06.166
You're enjoying it, right?

55:06.958 --> 55:08.250
I've really missed it.

55:23.291 --> 55:25.583
Is it because he's nice
or is it because of his money?

55:28.291 --> 55:29.250
Voke...

55:36.291 --> 55:37.416
I was hustling.

55:40.166 --> 55:41.166
Voke...

56:44.083 --> 56:45.791
The little money I had...

56:46.916 --> 56:48.458
you were taking it from me.

56:48.541 --> 56:50.416
You knew I was always going out to hustle.

56:50.500 --> 56:52.500
-Just...
-Voke.

57:13.916 --> 57:14.875
Voke...

58:15.291 --> 58:16.958
They've killed another person.

58:17.541 --> 58:20.041
I mean another person has died.

58:21.875 --> 58:23.458
Edere Boloko is dead.

58:24.291 --> 58:25.333
Where?

58:25.416 --> 58:27.041
At his house.

58:30.916 --> 58:32.541
People are wicked.

58:38.958 --> 58:41.125
This is the guy I was talking about.

58:42.083 --> 58:44.708
Voke, come here.

59:20.125 --> 59:21.333
Sorry for your loss, madam.

59:58.708 --> 01:00:00.750
What does that have to do with this?

01:00:16.208 --> 01:00:17.583
You are joking, right?

01:00:18.166 --> 01:00:20.625
Are you serious?
They kicked me off the board.

01:00:21.291 --> 01:00:24.500
Now they want me to sell my shares
from my own father's company.

01:00:27.250 --> 01:00:30.500
Then, I discovered Tony killed my father.
He doesn't know I'm aware.

01:00:31.333 --> 01:00:33.416
What happened to Kayode is nothing

01:00:33.500 --> 01:00:36.750
compared to what I, Leke Thompson,
will do to them all.

01:00:36.833 --> 01:00:37.958
They'll all get hurt.

01:00:51.583 --> 01:00:52.833
Laide Folarin.

01:01:37.791 --> 01:01:38.916
Let me try?

01:01:59.125 --> 01:02:00.458
That small boy.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:03.791
Raheem, go and arrest him!

01:02:04.625 --> 01:02:05.875
Voke, you will follow them.

01:02:05.958 --> 01:02:07.750
Only you can handle this one.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.041
-Get there before she does.
-Okay, sir.

01:02:46.416 --> 01:02:47.500
Voke!

01:02:54.625 --> 01:02:56.708
-I need to go and talk to him.
-You can't go in.

01:04:21.250 --> 01:04:22.166
What happened?

01:04:22.250 --> 01:04:23.875
Leke... His room.

01:06:52.791 --> 01:06:54.666
See, you said he wouldn't come.

01:06:59.916 --> 01:07:01.333
If you move, I'll shoot you.

01:07:01.875 --> 01:07:02.875
I say stop there.

01:07:30.416 --> 01:07:32.000
Voke!

01:07:32.666 --> 01:07:34.458
-Take me home!
-I can't take you home.

01:07:35.875 --> 01:07:37.666
There are things you don't know about me.

01:07:37.750 --> 01:07:39.791
If you don't want me to die,
take me home now!

01:08:00.333 --> 01:08:02.333
I found it.

01:08:45.333 --> 01:08:46.416
Get this off.

01:09:29.833 --> 01:09:30.958
Voke!

01:09:31.541 --> 01:09:33.833
Voke? Voke!

01:09:33.916 --> 01:09:38.125
Voke!

01:09:38.208 --> 01:09:40.916
Chisom! Chisom! Shut up! Calm down.

01:09:49.166 --> 01:09:51.458
Break it gently.

01:10:47.083 --> 01:10:50.625
Voke! Voke!

01:11:03.250 --> 01:11:05.208
Chisom! Chisom!

01:11:06.666 --> 01:11:07.791
Chisom!

01:11:21.333 --> 01:11:22.333
Voke!

01:11:25.583 --> 01:11:26.708
Chisom.

01:11:37.375 --> 01:11:38.875
You did well.

01:12:07.125 --> 01:12:08.125
Take this.

01:12:16.833 --> 01:12:18.583
Everything was making sense.

01:14:11.791 --> 01:14:12.708
What's up?

01:14:14.916 --> 01:14:15.875
What's up?

01:14:20.625 --> 01:14:21.875
Where are you going?

01:14:28.333 --> 01:14:30.291
Did you see what that guy
did to the police?

01:14:50.916 --> 01:14:52.041
My mother.

01:15:00.750 --> 01:15:01.666
Voke!

01:15:03.083 --> 01:15:04.125
Voke!

01:15:05.708 --> 01:15:08.500
You should have told me
about all this black magic stuff.

01:15:12.916 --> 01:15:15.666
That's not something one
can easily tell someone.

01:15:16.958 --> 01:15:19.125
Chisom, I didn't think
you would accept me.

01:15:19.208 --> 01:15:20.791
Do I look like I wouldn't accept you?

01:15:21.500 --> 01:15:22.458
Do I?

01:15:47.291 --> 01:15:50.166
My other phone is low on battery.
Let me give you this number.

01:15:52.541 --> 01:15:53.583
Chisom.

01:16:14.666 --> 01:16:15.750
What's happening?

01:16:24.333 --> 01:16:25.416
Where is it?

01:16:26.291 --> 01:16:30.125
That's good. Or else,
I will be in trouble with my wife.

01:16:31.416 --> 01:16:33.791
I told you the native doctor is around.

01:16:33.875 --> 01:16:35.291
Everything is set.

01:16:35.375 --> 01:16:37.750
I've locked everywhere,
nothing will happen.

01:16:37.833 --> 01:16:38.750
I'm invincible.

01:16:38.833 --> 01:16:42.666
Please tell the police
to be on standby. Okay!

01:16:50.333 --> 01:16:52.083
Go check what's going on over there.

01:17:14.541 --> 01:17:16.541
-What's happening?
-Is he here?

01:17:46.708 --> 01:17:47.583
Mike!

01:17:48.125 --> 01:17:49.250
Mike! Where are you?

01:17:49.958 --> 01:17:51.250
Call the native doctor.

01:17:53.083 --> 01:17:54.250
Call the native doctor!

01:18:07.125 --> 01:18:10.500
Babe, don't worry.
Nothing will happen. Be calm.

01:18:12.041 --> 01:18:13.541
-He's in the house.
-What's wrong?

01:18:22.375 --> 01:18:23.416
Shoot! Shoot!

01:18:24.375 --> 01:18:26.125
The native doctor is around.

01:18:27.958 --> 01:18:30.291
Where are you going?

01:19:03.750 --> 01:19:05.958
Boss, we need to leave here now.

01:19:06.875 --> 01:19:08.625
-Is he inside?
-Yes! He is!

01:19:08.708 --> 01:19:10.041
Hey!

01:19:15.750 --> 01:19:17.375
-I'm in the closet.
-Stay on the line.

01:19:25.375 --> 01:19:27.583
-Mother!
-I know what you want to ask.

01:19:27.666 --> 01:19:30.625
Someone I really care about
is about to be murdered.

01:19:31.125 --> 01:19:32.791
I need father's traveling magic.

01:19:32.875 --> 01:19:34.125
And I need it now.

01:19:34.625 --> 01:19:37.208
Voke, this is the cause
of your father's predicament.

01:19:37.291 --> 01:19:40.125
Father knew it will cost him,
but he did what he had to do.

01:19:40.208 --> 01:19:41.166
He saved you.

01:19:41.250 --> 01:19:42.375
Voke, I can't.

01:19:44.208 --> 01:19:47.833
You're my only child.
You're the only one left.

01:19:47.916 --> 01:19:50.416
Has father ever told you
that he regrets his action?

01:19:51.125 --> 01:19:53.208
Has he ever told you
that he regrets his action?

01:19:53.291 --> 01:19:55.750
He's in the room. I'm in the closet.

01:19:57.166 --> 01:19:59.750
I have money. Please!

01:20:00.625 --> 01:20:03.291
I'm begging you.

01:20:23.250 --> 01:20:27.208
I don't regret at all
that I gave my years for you.

01:20:27.291 --> 01:20:30.750
I will do it again,
if I get another opportunity.

01:20:30.833 --> 01:20:32.750
But he is my only child.

01:20:34.500 --> 01:20:37.708
He's my only child, Ede.
He's my only child.

01:20:38.208 --> 01:20:40.083
-Mother, what did you say?
-I can't!

01:20:40.166 --> 01:20:41.541
Please!

01:20:44.833 --> 01:20:47.291
Voke, it will take years from your life.

01:20:47.833 --> 01:20:49.000
Let it take it.

01:20:49.083 --> 01:20:50.083
Please!

01:20:50.958 --> 01:20:53.333
It's his own years to give.

01:20:54.083 --> 01:20:56.916
Let him make the choice himself.

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.041
Ede, I can hear you.

01:20:59.125 --> 01:21:02.541
But he's the only child I have left.

01:21:12.958 --> 01:21:14.250
Voke!

01:21:18.583 --> 01:21:20.750
What's this nonsense?

01:21:21.833 --> 01:21:25.375
Picture the person you want to travel to.

01:21:27.750 --> 01:21:29.000
Imagine it in your head.

01:21:29.791 --> 01:21:30.958
Picture it in your mind.

01:21:32.125 --> 01:21:33.500
You're lucky I love you.

01:21:40.875 --> 01:21:42.833
I love you so much.

01:22:05.166 --> 01:22:07.000
He's awake. Oh my God!

01:22:12.250 --> 01:22:13.458
-Stop!
-It's not working.

01:22:16.166 --> 01:22:17.916
It can't pierce his body.
Stop it. Just go!

01:22:42.166 --> 01:22:45.333
If you want the bullets to work,
bring them out and urinate on them.

01:22:45.416 --> 01:22:48.500
-Urinate on bullets?
-If you want it to work, urinate on them.

01:22:48.583 --> 01:22:51.166
Bring out the bullets!
Urinate on them! Out! Go now!

01:24:57.833 --> 01:24:58.875
Rogba!

01:25:03.500 --> 01:25:04.750
Rogba!

01:25:08.166 --> 01:25:09.666
Rogba.

01:25:09.750 --> 01:25:10.791
Lolu.

01:25:10.875 --> 01:25:12.500
Lolu. My goddaughter.

01:25:13.958 --> 01:25:15.125
Rogba!

01:25:38.875 --> 01:25:41.458
It's the traveling black magic,
but that's not the point.

01:25:42.958 --> 01:25:45.375
You killed Rogba,
when he was trying to say something.

01:26:41.375 --> 01:26:42.541
Chisom.

01:26:44.291 --> 01:26:45.416
Voke.

01:27:19.750 --> 01:27:20.916
Voke.

01:28:16.166 --> 01:28:17.208
Voke...

01:31:04.208 --> 01:31:05.375
Onajite!

01:32:12.416 --> 01:32:14.125
-Onajite!
-Are you not afraid?

01:32:14.208 --> 01:32:16.458
-Onajite!
-You will find out what I'll do to you.

01:32:16.541 --> 01:32:17.750
Onajite!

01:32:18.791 --> 01:32:19.750
Onajite!

01:32:21.500 --> 01:32:22.375
Come here!

01:32:22.875 --> 01:32:23.750
Come here!

01:32:25.875 --> 01:32:27.083
Come here!

01:32:31.916 --> 01:32:33.125
Keep quiet!

01:32:36.875 --> 01:32:40.208
You're raging with a knife.
Do you want to stab someone?

01:33:00.083 --> 01:33:01.041
I know you.

01:33:02.375 --> 01:33:04.791
I know your mother and father.

01:33:05.875 --> 01:33:06.750
My father?

01:33:08.083 --> 01:33:09.416
What happened?

01:33:09.500 --> 01:33:11.375
Why did she attack me like that?

01:33:12.291 --> 01:33:14.875
Onajite?
You killed the father of her child.

01:33:15.916 --> 01:33:16.791
Rogba?

01:33:16.875 --> 01:33:18.000
Is that his name?

01:33:18.458 --> 01:33:20.833
Did you two know each other that well?

01:33:20.916 --> 01:33:22.333
He's like a brother to me.

01:33:25.625 --> 01:33:27.000
Old man, what's happening?

01:33:29.833 --> 01:33:33.250
I know that this is what brought you here.

01:33:33.333 --> 01:33:35.083
You want to know what happened.

01:33:36.708 --> 01:33:38.041
And you will.

01:33:39.541 --> 01:33:41.791
Do you have the courage to hear it?

01:33:43.083 --> 01:33:44.875
There's nothing my eyes haven't seen.

01:33:46.791 --> 01:33:48.000
Okay!

01:33:49.166 --> 01:33:51.666
Come inside.

01:34:11.041 --> 01:34:14.416
Elder, don't be upset,
but I just want to know.

01:34:16.041 --> 01:34:18.750
What happened to my friend, Rogba?

01:34:20.666 --> 01:34:22.250
We'll start from the beginning.

01:34:24.083 --> 01:34:25.250
Onajite.

01:34:26.208 --> 01:34:27.708
You brought him to this house.

01:34:29.750 --> 01:34:31.083
Tell him how it happened.

01:34:33.375 --> 01:34:34.416
Tell him.

01:34:41.208 --> 01:34:43.833
They said
they found his body by the waterside.

01:34:46.041 --> 01:34:48.208
He was badly injured, but he was lucky.

01:34:49.416 --> 01:34:51.666
He was rescued and taken to the hospital.

01:34:53.416 --> 01:34:55.458
Because he almost died in the process,

01:34:56.125 --> 01:34:58.916
he didn't know who he was,
or where he came from.

01:35:01.291 --> 01:35:05.500
People started saying maybe he was insane.
But I didn't think of it that way.

01:35:06.541 --> 01:35:07.583
I just liked him.

01:35:11.750 --> 01:35:14.291
There was a certain way he smiled at me.

01:35:15.791 --> 01:35:17.458
He would say, "Auntie Jiji,

01:35:18.291 --> 01:35:20.083
"is there anything nice in the okra soup?"

01:35:20.166 --> 01:35:22.333
I would say,
"You are crazy. Who is your auntie?"

01:35:23.958 --> 01:35:25.416
Then he would laugh.

01:35:31.333 --> 01:35:32.750
That's how we became close.

01:35:34.083 --> 01:35:36.125
After a while, the hospital complained.

01:35:36.625 --> 01:35:40.708
It was odd how no one came to claim him.

01:35:41.375 --> 01:35:42.750
They had to discharge him.

01:35:44.541 --> 01:35:45.916
Since he had nowhere to go,

01:35:46.750 --> 01:35:48.583
I told him to come and stay here.

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:51.833
Do you get it now?

01:35:52.291 --> 01:35:53.458
Do you get it now?

01:35:58.708 --> 01:36:00.625
I've never had a man who loved me.

01:36:04.333 --> 01:36:05.583
None at all!

01:36:06.833 --> 01:36:09.041
No man has ever loved me...

01:36:10.208 --> 01:36:11.666
Onajite, that's enough.

01:36:17.250 --> 01:36:19.125
Go inside and rest.

01:36:22.125 --> 01:36:23.250
Go and rest.

01:36:26.166 --> 01:36:27.125
It's okay.

01:36:30.833 --> 01:36:32.500
But I searched for him.

01:36:34.500 --> 01:36:37.375
I even sent divers
to search for him in the river.

01:36:37.958 --> 01:36:39.291
We couldn't find him.

01:36:39.375 --> 01:36:40.583
Don't blame yourself.

01:36:46.250 --> 01:36:48.625
So, why was he killing people?

01:36:51.500 --> 01:36:52.916
When he came here,

01:36:54.833 --> 01:36:55.958
I liked him.

01:36:58.541 --> 01:37:01.333
My daughter, Jite, got pregnant.

01:37:02.541 --> 01:37:05.500
That's when I realized
he doesn't sleep at night.

01:37:06.291 --> 01:37:09.458
He keeps tossing and turning
and shouting every night.

01:37:11.500 --> 01:37:12.708
He sweats profusely.

01:37:13.708 --> 01:37:15.708
I said nobody can live like this.

01:37:20.500 --> 01:37:22.625
I decided to look into it.

01:37:24.541 --> 01:37:26.875
What my eyes saw,
my mouth cannot speak of.

01:37:31.916 --> 01:37:34.958
The situation was
too much for me to handle.

01:37:36.791 --> 01:37:39.875
The girl haunting his dreams
was his child.

01:37:40.625 --> 01:37:43.000
They sacrificed the child.

01:37:44.041 --> 01:37:47.791
They removed five of her body parts
and gave it to Esu.

01:37:47.875 --> 01:37:49.791
Her eyes, her heart,

01:37:50.375 --> 01:37:53.041
her tongue, her liver, and her lungs.

01:37:53.750 --> 01:37:55.250
It was all just because of money.

01:37:56.583 --> 01:38:00.375
But the father and daughter's
connection was too strong.

01:38:00.458 --> 01:38:03.416
Even though
they were feeding on the child's spirit,

01:38:03.500 --> 01:38:06.083
the girl kept begging to be saved.

01:38:06.166 --> 01:38:11.083
Esu takes five years
to feed on anything sacrificed to it.

01:38:11.583 --> 01:38:15.083
And when it's done feeding,
it will ask for another one.

01:38:16.291 --> 01:38:20.750
And when this happens,
the child's spirit will suffer forever.

01:38:20.833 --> 01:38:22.500
Terrible suffering!

01:38:22.583 --> 01:38:24.958
And, this wasn't
the first time they did this.

01:38:25.541 --> 01:38:27.166
They've been doing it for a long time.

01:38:27.958 --> 01:38:30.083
So Rogba was trying to stop them?

01:38:31.666 --> 01:38:33.791
Not exactly.

01:38:33.875 --> 01:38:34.833
What then?

01:38:36.416 --> 01:38:37.541
Listen to me.

01:38:38.958 --> 01:38:43.958
If he had gotten the organs back from the
same people who took them from the child

01:38:44.041 --> 01:38:47.500
and offered them to Esu,
he would've saved the girl's spirit.

01:38:49.541 --> 01:38:52.541
He could've left
his child's spirit to suffer forever

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:57.958
or kill the people
who killed his daughter.

01:39:04.708 --> 01:39:06.416
He was trying to save Lolu.

01:39:06.500 --> 01:39:11.208
Now, the child's spirit
will continue to suffer forever.

01:39:12.458 --> 01:39:17.000
The protection suit and mask that
I made for him aren't powerful anymore.

01:39:17.791 --> 01:39:18.958
I will do it.

01:39:22.291 --> 01:39:23.833
One person remains.

01:39:25.708 --> 01:39:28.750
The person who ate the girl's heart.

01:39:38.875 --> 01:39:40.041
Voke...

01:39:46.083 --> 01:39:46.958
Chisom!

01:39:48.291 --> 01:39:49.916
As of now...

01:39:50.958 --> 01:39:52.708
it's been too long.

01:39:53.750 --> 01:39:55.750
Time is running out.

01:39:57.333 --> 01:39:59.083
If it's not done by sunrise,

01:40:01.083 --> 01:40:02.625
her spirit will be lost forever.

01:40:03.958 --> 01:40:06.583
That's if they haven't
made a new sacrifice already.

01:40:14.750 --> 01:40:15.958
You're welcome.

01:40:17.250 --> 01:40:18.333
You're welcome.

01:41:04.875 --> 01:41:06.458
Voke! Voke!

01:41:19.083 --> 01:41:20.291
Rogba.

01:41:21.333 --> 01:41:22.208
Lolu.

01:41:30.416 --> 01:41:31.416
I'm listening!

01:42:08.458 --> 01:42:10.500
My father couldn't kill my mom.

01:42:35.291 --> 01:42:37.375
Why did you choose Lolu?

01:43:24.083 --> 01:43:25.125
Voke.

01:43:58.833 --> 01:43:59.708
Voke...

01:44:18.500 --> 01:44:19.625
Voke...

01:45:00.791 --> 01:45:02.333
You know I'll do anything for you.

01:45:03.583 --> 01:45:04.541
I love you so much.

01:45:04.625 --> 01:45:06.708
We can finally be together.

01:45:14.708 --> 01:45:17.000
I promised you I would take care of her.

01:45:17.083 --> 01:45:18.958
I held her in my arms when she was born.

01:45:19.041 --> 01:45:20.250
She's my child.

01:45:20.333 --> 01:45:24.041
If it's not done by sunrise,
her spirit will be lost forever.

01:45:43.416 --> 01:45:44.833
Voke.

01:45:46.833 --> 01:45:47.958
I can't do it.

01:45:53.541 --> 01:45:54.750
I can't do it.

01:45:59.916 --> 01:46:03.041
You wanted us to be together.

01:46:10.666 --> 01:46:11.916
Voke.

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:55.916
I didn't think you would kill the girl.

01:48:02.416 --> 01:48:04.500
That's where you differ from your father.

01:48:11.250 --> 01:48:13.166
This means you have saved the little girl.

01:48:15.125 --> 01:48:16.500
Lolu?

01:48:44.500 --> 01:48:45.708
Why did you help me?

01:48:49.625 --> 01:48:50.750
It's not for free.

01:48:56.416 --> 01:48:57.458
I'll call you.

01:49:15.625 --> 01:49:17.416
I was trying to search for the truth.

01:49:17.500 --> 01:49:19.291
But I lost my best friend

01:49:20.208 --> 01:49:21.958
and the love of my life.

01:49:22.750 --> 01:49:24.416
Even though I saved Lolu,

01:49:25.875 --> 01:49:29.000
these are things
you'd think a man couldn't handle.

01:49:30.375 --> 01:49:32.875
But I'm still here.

01:49:33.708 --> 01:49:35.083
Standing tall.

01:50:07.166 --> 01:50:09.208
A guy showed me his picture,
told me to kill him.

01:50:13.750 --> 01:50:16.625
We've searched everywhere
but we couldn't find him.
