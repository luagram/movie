WEBVTT

01:41.753 --> 01:42.885
...salute you.

03:57.889 --> 03:59.891
Be gentle, Hanno.

05:23.671 --> 05:26.326
We invoke you
by your great names

05:26.500 --> 05:28.153
to come to our aid.

05:28.328 --> 05:29.938
Defeat the Romans.

05:30.112 --> 05:31.592
Destroy their ships,

05:31.766 --> 05:33.289
their engines of war,

05:33.463 --> 05:35.247
and their soldiers.

05:35.422 --> 05:38.338
We will prevail.

05:43.386 --> 05:45.170
Ozalsces.

05:47.782 --> 05:49.305
Arishat.

06:03.711 --> 06:04.973
Hanno.

06:08.411 --> 06:11.327
You did not make
an offering today.

06:11.501 --> 06:13.808
I prefer to sacrifice a Roman.

06:29.693 --> 06:31.042
Where you are,

06:32.174 --> 06:33.175
I am, too.

06:37.179 --> 06:38.746
And where you are,

06:38.920 --> 06:41.749
I am, too, forever.

06:41.923 --> 06:43.359
My wife.

07:19.090 --> 07:21.658
The wind is too strong.
Furl sail and strike water.

07:21.832 --> 07:24.095
Furl sail,
strike water!

07:24.269 --> 07:26.184
Furl sail
and strike water!

07:34.541 --> 07:36.543
Strike water!

08:03.961 --> 08:06.834
They have no lands
but the ones they've stolen.

08:07.008 --> 08:09.619
Wherever they go,
they leave destruction

08:09.793 --> 08:11.403
and call it peace.

08:13.362 --> 08:16.060
This is the last free city
in Africa Nova.

08:17.279 --> 08:20.282
Today, we go into battle.

08:21.718 --> 08:26.157
Pray that your god
is with you.
If he is not, he is no god.

08:29.421 --> 08:31.511
We've nothing to fear.

08:31.685 --> 08:33.513
Where death is, we are not.

08:34.470 --> 08:35.950
Where we are,

08:37.604 --> 08:38.779
death is not.

08:41.477 --> 08:43.000
Stay together and listen
for my commands.

08:46.787 --> 08:49.441
Your eyes up
and your head out.

09:24.781 --> 09:26.870
Fire!

09:31.788 --> 09:35.052
[man] Ready your weapons!

09:35.226 --> 09:36.358
Again!

09:42.451 --> 09:44.279
We're ablaze on the right!

09:45.585 --> 09:47.369
Keep formation!

09:51.068 --> 09:52.679
Pull!

09:59.120 --> 10:00.643
Archers ready.

10:00.817 --> 10:02.340
Release!

10:09.521 --> 10:10.566
Nock!

10:10.740 --> 10:12.960
Draw!

10:13.134 --> 10:14.352
Loose!

10:21.446 --> 10:22.578
Archers!

10:30.717 --> 10:32.327
Fire!

10:43.860 --> 10:46.820
- Raise the tower!
- Raise the tower!

11:02.879 --> 11:05.186
- Back astern!
- Back astern!

11:12.367 --> 11:14.195
Keep cranking.

11:24.248 --> 11:25.902
Drop drawbridge!

11:26.076 --> 11:27.556
The drawbridge is stuck!

11:37.261 --> 11:38.654
Sir!

11:41.178 --> 11:42.310
Loose!

11:54.104 --> 11:55.671
Back.

12:58.429 --> 12:59.822
Archers!

12:59.996 --> 13:01.041
There!

13:01.215 --> 13:02.477
Kill her!

13:03.347 --> 13:04.653
Arishat!

14:14.723 --> 14:16.681
Arishat.

14:28.041 --> 14:32.132
Arishat!

14:39.356 --> 14:41.228
I'll wait for you.

15:24.314 --> 15:26.055
Check all the bodies!

15:26.229 --> 15:28.014
Leave nothing!

17:16.948 --> 17:18.602
I claim this city...

17:21.431 --> 17:23.303
for the glory of Rome.

17:25.218 --> 17:26.915
<i>Vae victis.</i>

17:29.831 --> 17:31.398
Woe to the conquered.

17:50.547 --> 17:51.548
Next!

17:54.377 --> 17:55.378
Move it!

18:11.177 --> 18:14.310
- Down the stairs!
- Downstairs!

19:01.531 --> 19:04.491
Hey.

19:04.665 --> 19:06.754
What damage have they
done you, eh?

19:19.636 --> 19:21.551
Lift it up. Easy, easy.

19:21.725 --> 19:23.945
Hold that.

19:29.907 --> 19:31.213
Arishat?

19:34.608 --> 19:35.957
I am sorry, my son.

19:39.526 --> 19:41.136
I have not long.

19:42.529 --> 19:44.487
This galley

19:44.661 --> 19:46.968
is sailing us to something
I cannot endure.

19:47.142 --> 19:50.189
I am ready... to be taken
to another place.

19:50.363 --> 19:52.365
Stay here a while longer.

19:55.803 --> 20:00.373
I remember well
when you first
were brought to us.

20:00.547 --> 20:03.550
A lonely boy
from the desert.
Guileless.

20:03.724 --> 20:04.899
Afraid.

20:06.074 --> 20:09.164
You embraced everything
we taught you.

20:11.471 --> 20:15.518
You found Arishat's love.
Your soul was replenished.

20:16.867 --> 20:20.044
When I die,

20:20.219 --> 20:23.004
my ancestors will meet me
in the next world.

20:25.136 --> 20:26.355
Who will meet you?

20:26.529 --> 20:28.662
Hanno,

20:28.836 --> 20:30.664
I am done.

20:30.838 --> 20:34.102
Do not let them change
what you are.

21:05.786 --> 21:06.830
Have you seen this boy?

21:12.271 --> 21:14.447
Eama! Eama!

21:19.887 --> 21:22.281
You must
go alone now, Hanno.

21:25.980 --> 21:27.851
Never let them find you.

21:32.552 --> 21:34.423
Go. Go.

23:27.536 --> 23:30.713
Acacius! Acacius! Acacius!

23:30.887 --> 23:32.106
Emperor Geta.

23:34.413 --> 23:36.066
Emperor Caracalla.

23:37.677 --> 23:39.243
General Acacius.

23:39.418 --> 23:42.333
I have taken Numidia
in your names

23:42.508 --> 23:44.248
that your dominion
may eclipse that

23:44.423 --> 23:46.512
of every emperor
that came before you.

23:46.686 --> 23:49.123
Crown him with laurels, brother.

23:58.088 --> 24:01.222
Acacius! Acacius! Acacius!

24:06.836 --> 24:08.708
In honor
of your conquest,

24:09.709 --> 24:11.798
there will be games
in the Colosseum.

24:13.060 --> 24:15.584
I require no games
in my honor.

24:15.758 --> 24:19.196
Serving the Senate
and the people of Rome

24:19.370 --> 24:21.024
is honor enough for me.

24:21.198 --> 24:23.897
You are too modest,
Acacius.

24:24.071 --> 24:27.161
It does not suit a general
as accomplished as yourself.

24:29.424 --> 24:32.166
The glory is yours,
not mine.

24:32.340 --> 24:35.343
I only ask for
some respite from war

24:35.517 --> 24:36.953
to spend time
with my wife.

24:37.127 --> 24:39.478
Your wife, yes.

24:39.652 --> 24:41.218
Remember the privileges
we have granted her?

24:42.872 --> 24:44.874
Where is she now
to ignore such an occasion?

24:45.048 --> 24:47.703
There are victories
yet still to come.

24:49.400 --> 24:50.880
Persia.

24:52.273 --> 24:53.143
India.

24:54.580 --> 24:58.018
Both... must be conquered.

24:59.976 --> 25:02.457
Rome has so many subjects.

25:02.631 --> 25:04.503
She must feed them.

25:05.765 --> 25:07.984
They can eat war.

25:10.900 --> 25:13.990
Your triumphs
will be celebrated

25:14.861 --> 25:17.254
as a tribute
to the greatness

25:18.038 --> 25:19.343
of the Roman people.

25:41.714 --> 25:42.758
Go to hell!

26:02.996 --> 26:05.346
Macrinus of Thysdrus,

26:05.520 --> 26:07.609
master of gladiators!

26:30.197 --> 26:32.025
Stay close.

26:48.476 --> 26:52.219
Aediles
and the town councilors,

26:52.959 --> 26:55.526
distinguished guests,

26:56.615 --> 26:58.486
citizens of Antium,

27:02.229 --> 27:04.579
behold the fate

27:05.972 --> 27:08.539
of the conquered enemies
of Rome:

27:09.932 --> 27:14.633
The barbarian Numidians
and their chieftain,

27:15.459 --> 27:18.288
Jugurtha!

28:38.629 --> 28:39.892
This one is interesting.

29:06.745 --> 29:08.137
I'll buy him.

29:29.158 --> 29:32.379
Halt! Who goes there?

29:33.946 --> 29:35.164
General.

30:10.678 --> 30:12.245
My lady.

30:20.514 --> 30:22.821
I thank the gods
that brought you back home safe.

30:22.995 --> 30:25.998
Thank the Army.
They protected me.

30:27.782 --> 30:28.914
Mm.

30:30.002 --> 30:31.655
Let me feed you.

30:59.379 --> 31:00.380
Go.

31:01.120 --> 31:02.469
To the wall.

31:13.306 --> 31:15.569
The arena
is a sacred temple.

31:15.743 --> 31:17.310
For the bravest of you,

31:17.484 --> 31:20.269
the road to glory
runs through the arena.

31:20.443 --> 31:22.402
The arena turns slaves
into gladiators

31:22.576 --> 31:24.404
and gladiators into free men.

31:31.715 --> 31:33.239
You have worms.

31:37.243 --> 31:40.507
I know this one.
He eats monkeys.

31:54.782 --> 31:57.045
Go. Sit. Eat.

32:57.714 --> 32:58.759
You.

33:00.195 --> 33:02.545
Hanno, get up.

33:08.551 --> 33:12.599
What is
your native language?
I speak them all.

33:16.255 --> 33:19.388
You don't answer because
you can't or because you won't?

33:21.608 --> 33:22.739
Mm, all right.

33:22.913 --> 33:26.613
Violence...
is the universal language.

33:26.787 --> 33:29.398
Viggo,
put him through his paces.

33:29.572 --> 33:33.359
He can fight an ape.
Let's see if he
can fight a man.

34:43.255 --> 34:44.343
Enough!

34:48.912 --> 34:50.088
Very good.

34:51.611 --> 34:52.960
Very good.

34:55.005 --> 34:56.355
Hose him down.

35:00.185 --> 35:01.577
Bring him to me.

35:08.584 --> 35:09.890
Ah!

35:12.849 --> 35:14.547
A strong jaw.

35:16.375 --> 35:17.724
Good arms.

35:19.378 --> 35:20.596
Better smell.

35:23.730 --> 35:25.210
You will do well.

35:26.036 --> 35:27.821
It is an art,

35:27.995 --> 35:29.823
choosing gladiators.

35:31.303 --> 35:33.479
Some choose entertainers.

35:33.653 --> 35:35.611
Some choose brute force.

35:35.785 --> 35:37.222
I choose rage.

35:41.748 --> 35:43.228
Crowd loves blood.

35:43.402 --> 35:45.055
And they love those who
love blood as much as they do.

35:45.230 --> 35:47.623
And you, my friend, rage

35:48.407 --> 35:50.583
pours out of you like...

35:52.062 --> 35:53.586
like milk...

35:55.240 --> 35:56.502
from a whore's tit.

35:57.590 --> 35:59.244
You will be
quite the fighter.

35:59.418 --> 36:00.897
Not for you.

36:01.071 --> 36:03.073
You're right,
you do not fight for me.

36:03.248 --> 36:05.511
I put you in the ring,
you fight or you die.

36:05.685 --> 36:06.773
The choice is yours.

36:06.947 --> 36:09.819
But whose head
could I give you

36:09.993 --> 36:13.519
that would satisfy this fury?

36:13.693 --> 36:15.521
The entire Roman Army's.

36:19.089 --> 36:20.134
Too much.

36:20.308 --> 36:21.831
Mm.

36:22.005 --> 36:24.007
The general will do.

36:24.182 --> 36:25.095
General?

36:26.532 --> 36:28.447
- General Acacius?
- Mm.

36:30.840 --> 36:33.321
Use your rage
in my service,

36:33.495 --> 36:37.238
and you will have his head
ready for your sword.

36:38.544 --> 36:41.547
Serve me and I will serve you.
Deny me...

36:42.939 --> 36:45.420
and you will die.

36:48.510 --> 36:50.164
There are times I wished
you'd abandoned me

36:50.338 --> 36:52.035
rather than
fight their wars.

36:52.210 --> 36:54.168
I've made my choice.

36:56.214 --> 36:58.085
I can live with it.

37:02.263 --> 37:05.135
But my patience with those two
is at an end.

37:07.964 --> 37:10.097
Leta?

37:10.271 --> 37:13.709
You may go
to your quarters now.
We need nothing more.

37:20.934 --> 37:22.457
To hear wives and mothers
mourning their dead

37:22.631 --> 37:24.285
on that beach at Numidia...

37:26.853 --> 37:28.463
Lucilla.

37:33.642 --> 37:35.078
No more.

37:37.516 --> 37:39.561
I will not waste

37:39.735 --> 37:43.217
another generation
of young men for their vanity.

37:45.480 --> 37:48.962
If I fight another campaign,
it must be to depose them.

37:50.920 --> 37:52.966
When will your troops
arrive?

37:53.836 --> 37:56.099
They land at Ostia
in ten days.

37:56.274 --> 38:00.190
How many of them will be
loyal to you alone?

38:01.888 --> 38:03.237
All of them.

38:05.370 --> 38:08.895
The emperors do not have
the support of the people.

38:09.069 --> 38:13.726
The people are weary
of the madness, the tyranny.

38:16.859 --> 38:20.863
What is the dream of Rome
if her people are not free?

38:43.364 --> 38:45.714
Enjoy yourself,
everyone,

38:45.888 --> 38:47.803
to excess!

38:47.977 --> 38:50.850
Thank you. Thank you.

39:02.862 --> 39:04.124
Oh!

39:04.907 --> 39:07.910
Please, drink.

39:08.084 --> 39:10.870
Ah! Excuse me. Macrinus!

39:12.262 --> 39:14.830
I knew the provinces
were not enough for you.

39:15.004 --> 39:18.094
I'm just here
- for the games.
- Ah, well,

39:18.268 --> 39:19.792
you won't be disappointed.

39:19.966 --> 39:23.099
Rome has all the games
that men like you like to play.

39:23.273 --> 39:25.450
Men like me, Thraex?
Men like us.

39:25.624 --> 39:29.018
I know nothing happens
in Rome unless you've
tasted it first.

39:45.687 --> 39:47.167
What is my purpose here?

39:47.341 --> 39:48.690
You'll find out soon enough.

39:53.391 --> 39:55.480
What's this we hear
about you being interested

39:55.654 --> 39:59.266
in standing for election
to the Senate, Macrinus?

39:59.440 --> 40:01.877
Me? No, I'm, uh...

40:02.051 --> 40:04.445
I don't even know how
to use an abacus.

40:04.619 --> 40:06.316
But I do understand that

40:07.622 --> 40:08.841
it's customary
for your guests

40:09.015 --> 40:11.539
to make wagers
at these affairs?

40:11.713 --> 40:13.889
How large a sum
did you have in mind?

40:15.543 --> 40:16.936
A thousand gold denarii?

40:17.110 --> 40:18.416
Two.

40:20.374 --> 40:21.549
Two?

40:23.551 --> 40:25.771
Denarii.

40:41.743 --> 40:44.442
Stand back! Stand back!

40:46.139 --> 40:47.532
My emperors.

40:47.706 --> 40:51.666
Lords, ladies and gentlemen,
and senators.

40:51.840 --> 40:54.103
For your entertainment,

40:54.843 --> 40:57.106
the art of combat!

40:59.282 --> 41:00.936
May I present

41:01.110 --> 41:03.112
the barbarian versus,

41:03.286 --> 41:07.334
from my own stable,
the mighty Vichek!

41:14.646 --> 41:17.213
- This is your gladiator?
- It is.

41:20.695 --> 41:23.176
Three rounds,
hand to hand.

41:23.350 --> 41:24.917
Swords!

41:25.091 --> 41:28.311
We want swords.
A fight to the death.

41:29.704 --> 41:32.577
No quarter to be offered...
or given.

41:32.751 --> 41:34.796
Fight now!

41:40.280 --> 41:41.411
Brother,

41:42.587 --> 41:44.240
let's not kill each other
for their amusement.

42:50.611 --> 42:52.178
Remarkable!

42:54.702 --> 42:56.225
Remarkable!

42:57.487 --> 42:59.446
Thraex,
he looked expensive.

43:00.795 --> 43:02.971
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

43:03.972 --> 43:05.321
Remarkable.

43:09.891 --> 43:11.414
From where do you hail?

43:17.159 --> 43:18.421
Speak.

43:22.121 --> 43:23.252
I said speak.

43:23.426 --> 43:25.037
He is from the colonies,
Your Majesty.

43:25.211 --> 43:27.517
His native tongue
is all he understands.

43:34.046 --> 43:37.005
"The gates of hell
are open night and day.

43:38.616 --> 43:43.621
Smooth is the descent,
and easy is the way.

43:46.362 --> 43:48.669
But...

43:50.976 --> 43:52.847
to come back from hell

43:53.021 --> 43:54.762
and view the cheerful skies,

43:54.936 --> 43:59.462
in this the task
and mighty labor lies."

44:06.034 --> 44:07.340
Virgil, Your Majesty.

44:08.471 --> 44:09.385
Poetry!

44:12.867 --> 44:15.435
- Very clever, Macrinus.
- Thank you.

44:16.828 --> 44:19.047
I've grown so bored,
but you surprise me.

44:19.221 --> 44:22.181
To amuse you is my only wish.

44:22.355 --> 44:24.096
We are amused,
we are amused.

44:26.185 --> 44:27.447
We are amused.

44:28.927 --> 44:31.973
And we all look forward
to seeing your poet

44:33.105 --> 44:34.367
perform in the arena.

44:34.541 --> 44:37.413
As do I, Your Majesties.

44:38.240 --> 44:39.241
Thank you.

44:39.894 --> 44:40.721
Viggo?

44:42.201 --> 44:43.550
Come with me.

45:01.742 --> 45:04.136
You fought well today,
but you were lucky, too.

45:06.573 --> 45:09.010
The lines you recited.

45:09.184 --> 45:11.621
You didn't learn that
in Africa, I know that.

45:12.622 --> 45:14.712
- A good verse travels far.
- Mm.

45:14.886 --> 45:16.757
Who taught you poetry?

45:16.931 --> 45:19.064
A captured Roman officer.

45:19.238 --> 45:22.371
I was posted guard over him
and he used to tell us tales

45:22.545 --> 45:24.373
to pass the time.

45:25.374 --> 45:26.506
And what became
of this prisoner?

45:26.680 --> 45:28.116
Oh, we ate him.

45:29.509 --> 45:30.510
As barbarians do.

45:30.684 --> 45:32.947
As barbarians do.

45:33.121 --> 45:35.036
And where were you born?

45:35.210 --> 45:37.430
Why does my past matter
if it is my future

45:37.604 --> 45:39.737
to die for you in the arena?

45:46.526 --> 45:48.615
Tell me what use have I
for Roman money.

45:51.879 --> 45:53.402
A gladiator

45:54.360 --> 45:56.057
can buy his own freedom.

45:57.145 --> 45:58.930
His liberty.

45:59.887 --> 46:01.584
The Roman dream.

46:01.759 --> 46:03.673
No, the slave dreams
not of freedom

46:03.848 --> 46:06.241
but of a slave
to call his own.

46:07.155 --> 46:08.591
Cicero.

46:09.854 --> 46:12.160
Is that what you were
raised on, Macrinus?

46:13.945 --> 46:16.425
What did you have to do
for Roman money?

46:17.775 --> 46:19.254
You promised me a head.

46:19.428 --> 46:22.170
Earn your keep
and you can have
anyone's head.

46:46.455 --> 46:48.196
Father,

46:48.370 --> 46:50.808
protect us and guide us.

47:04.691 --> 47:06.040
Senators.

47:06.693 --> 47:07.868
My lady.

47:14.005 --> 47:17.443
My lady, I wish we were
meeting in better times.

47:18.313 --> 47:20.315
Better times will come.

47:21.621 --> 47:23.928
And why are we here?

47:24.102 --> 47:25.930
To take back the city.

47:27.845 --> 47:31.370
And restore Rome
to where she should be.

47:32.806 --> 47:34.677
An exciting venture.

47:35.983 --> 47:38.377
- When?
- On the final day
of the games.

47:39.378 --> 47:42.076
My army waits for my command
at Ostia.

47:42.250 --> 47:44.905
Five thousand soldiers
loyal to me...

47:46.472 --> 47:48.778
will enter Rome
and then the Colosseum,

47:48.953 --> 47:50.780
where they will
arrest the emperors

47:50.955 --> 47:52.521
for their crimes
against the Senate

47:53.435 --> 47:54.959
and their people.

47:55.960 --> 48:00.878
Uh, this plan
is ambitious and risky.

48:01.052 --> 48:03.706
Rome will be yours
to administer and to--

48:03.881 --> 48:08.450
Marcus Aurelius talked
of restoring power
to the Senate,

48:08.624 --> 48:12.846
but that was a generation ago.
Much has changed.

48:13.020 --> 48:16.850
The people
have not seen hope

48:17.024 --> 48:18.330
for many years.

48:18.504 --> 48:22.073
But with time...
and guidance...

48:23.813 --> 48:27.121
Lucilla, you are the daughter
of Marcus Aurelius.

48:27.295 --> 48:29.297
He had my loyalty.

48:31.082 --> 48:32.997
And so do you.

48:35.347 --> 48:36.783
Senator Thraex?

48:38.567 --> 48:41.919
Politics follows power,
my lady.

48:43.094 --> 48:46.053
Take back
what is rightfully yours...

48:47.098 --> 48:49.100
and the Senate
will support you.

48:50.231 --> 48:51.406
Thank you.

49:07.553 --> 49:08.946
Food! Food!

49:13.602 --> 49:15.909
When I was told of this place,

49:16.083 --> 49:18.216
they never mentioned
the stink.

49:20.218 --> 49:21.349
That would be Hanno.

49:24.787 --> 49:27.486
Well, you'll have to
put up with me as I am.

49:32.795 --> 49:35.842
And what's that up there?
A wolf?

49:37.626 --> 49:40.760
The twins there,
they were outcasts.

49:40.934 --> 49:42.588
Left in the hills to die.

49:44.155 --> 49:47.723
That wolf found them
and she suckled them
on her milk.

49:49.073 --> 49:51.292
Raised by an animal.
It's in their blood.

49:51.466 --> 49:54.252
How do you know this place?

49:55.470 --> 49:57.429
I know the chaos
they brought.

49:58.734 --> 50:01.433
This city infects
everything it touches.

50:01.607 --> 50:03.609
I never dreamt
it would be so big.

50:03.783 --> 50:05.437
Don't fall for it.

50:05.611 --> 50:07.569
This city is diseased.

50:08.918 --> 50:11.008
Food! Food!

50:34.814 --> 50:37.208
You! Barbarian scum!

50:43.170 --> 50:45.129
Help me.
Please, help me!

51:21.948 --> 51:23.167
- Ah!
- Thraex.

51:27.040 --> 51:27.997
About our wager.

51:28.172 --> 51:29.869
Ah. The barbarian.

51:30.043 --> 51:31.262
Yes, I haven't forgotten,
I always repay my debts.

51:31.436 --> 51:33.220
I was merely
going to suggest

51:33.394 --> 51:35.266
that perhaps your luck
might change.

51:35.440 --> 51:37.790
Shall we say
double or quits?

51:42.360 --> 51:43.448
- Ah.
- Ah.

51:55.808 --> 51:57.157
Get back!

52:11.476 --> 52:12.999
Fresh meat.

52:17.046 --> 52:18.918
Line up! Line up!

52:49.557 --> 52:52.125
Play! Play!

53:07.358 --> 53:09.621
Emperor Caracalla.

53:10.361 --> 53:12.189
Emperor Geta.

53:12.363 --> 53:14.887
Citizens of Rome!

53:16.932 --> 53:19.935
These sacred games

53:20.109 --> 53:23.243
are held to honor
the victory of Rome

53:23.417 --> 53:26.420
over the barbarians of Numidia.

53:27.769 --> 53:30.294
Go! Go!

53:33.253 --> 53:36.648
And to honor
Rome's legionary commander,

53:36.822 --> 53:38.954
General Justus Acacius!

53:39.128 --> 53:41.696
[man] Long live Acacius!

53:41.870 --> 53:43.263
And with him

53:43.437 --> 53:48.007
Lucilla, the daughter
of Emperor Marcus Aurelius.

53:49.922 --> 53:53.360
Lucilla![man] Mother of Rome!

53:54.361 --> 53:55.667
Acacius.

53:56.363 --> 53:57.364
General.

54:05.111 --> 54:08.332
Acacius! Acacius! Acacius!

54:08.506 --> 54:13.511
Acacius! Acacius! Acacius!

54:14.512 --> 54:15.469
Speak to them.

54:15.643 --> 54:18.037
Speak to us!

54:26.306 --> 54:29.004
I am not an orator

54:29.178 --> 54:30.702
or a politician.

54:32.007 --> 54:33.618
I am a soldier.

54:36.142 --> 54:41.321
I have seen bravery
in men and women during war.

54:42.104 --> 54:43.845
And even once in this arena.

54:45.456 --> 54:47.109
So if you ask anything
of the gods...

54:49.068 --> 54:51.375
ask for that same bravery.

54:53.725 --> 54:55.814
Because Rome needs it now.

54:59.992 --> 55:02.734
Acacius! Acacius! Acacius!

55:02.908 --> 55:06.085
Acacius! Acacius! Acacius!

55:18.750 --> 55:21.187
From the South Gate,

55:21.361 --> 55:26.323
fighters from the stable
of Macrinus of Thysdrus!

55:38.944 --> 55:40.859
From the stables

55:41.033 --> 55:44.515
of Emperors Caracalla
and Geta themselves,

55:44.689 --> 55:47.169
the undefeated champion:

55:47.344 --> 55:50.912
Glyceo the Destroyer!

55:57.615 --> 55:58.485
Hold.

56:21.421 --> 56:23.249
Hold.

56:24.555 --> 56:26.165
Hail Caesars!

56:27.819 --> 56:31.126
Glyceo! Glyceo! Glyceo!

56:42.921 --> 56:46.011
Hold together
and when it charges,
break for the wall.

56:46.185 --> 56:47.012
Why should I?

56:51.277 --> 56:52.147
Hold!

56:53.322 --> 56:54.367
Hold!

56:54.541 --> 56:55.412
Break!

56:56.500 --> 56:57.762
Cowards!

57:11.863 --> 57:13.908
To the wall!

57:25.964 --> 57:26.834
Come on!

59:10.285 --> 59:13.158
Brother, it's that poet,
is it not?

59:13.985 --> 59:15.900
I can't remember.

59:16.074 --> 59:17.728
That night was a blur.

59:19.164 --> 59:21.732
"The gates of hell
are open night and day.

59:21.906 --> 59:24.909
Smooth the desc--"
I forget.

59:25.083 --> 59:26.780
"Smooth the descent..."

59:27.651 --> 59:29.696
"Smooth is the descent,

59:30.262 --> 59:31.916
easy is the way."

59:39.663 --> 59:40.620
Shield!

01:00:16.874 --> 01:00:20.355
Mercy! Mercy! Mercy!

01:00:22.183 --> 01:00:23.402
Blood.

01:00:26.448 --> 01:00:27.580
Lucilla,

01:00:28.276 --> 01:00:29.495
shall we show mercy?

01:00:29.669 --> 01:00:31.279
Mercy.

01:00:46.643 --> 01:00:48.601
No mercy!

01:00:48.775 --> 01:00:50.559
Your life has been
spared by the gods--

01:00:50.734 --> 01:00:54.694
I would sooner face your blade
than accept Roman mercy!

01:01:10.841 --> 01:01:14.192
Kill! Kill! Kill!

01:01:14.366 --> 01:01:17.499
Kill! Kill! Kill!

01:01:28.989 --> 01:01:33.951
Hanno! Hanno! Hanno!

01:02:02.109 --> 01:02:04.721
The road to freedom
doesn't run
through the arena.

01:02:05.547 --> 01:02:07.071
It leads to this.

01:02:11.597 --> 01:02:13.512
Go to your cells.

01:02:17.429 --> 01:02:20.911
Hanno! Hanno! Hanno!

01:02:37.841 --> 01:02:39.190
Come on, let's go.

01:02:52.464 --> 01:02:55.684
"Gates of hell
are open night and day.

01:02:56.729 --> 01:02:58.296
Smooth is the descent...

01:02:58.470 --> 01:03:00.341
...easy is the way."

01:03:04.476 --> 01:03:06.783
<i>There, there, there, there.</i>

01:03:06.957 --> 01:03:08.219
<i>And I've got you.</i>

01:03:08.393 --> 01:03:10.961
<i>I'm Maximus,
the savior of Rome!</i>

01:03:30.589 --> 01:03:32.591
Scatto and Argento.

01:03:46.344 --> 01:03:47.693
Lucius is safe?

01:04:05.537 --> 01:04:06.581
Lucius!

01:04:19.290 --> 01:04:21.118
Lucius,

01:04:21.292 --> 01:04:24.208
you're the sole heir
to the throne now.

01:04:26.036 --> 01:04:27.254
There are men
who want to kill you

01:04:27.428 --> 01:04:28.865
so they can take power.

01:04:30.605 --> 01:04:33.739
I promise I'll bring you back
as soon as it's safe.

01:04:33.913 --> 01:04:37.438
Mother, why can't you
come with me?

01:04:37.612 --> 01:04:39.963
I... I have to
stay here for your sake.

01:04:40.137 --> 01:04:42.052
And for the sake of Rome.

01:04:42.226 --> 01:04:44.619
Remember who you are.

01:04:44.793 --> 01:04:46.665
And that I love you.

01:04:47.405 --> 01:04:48.754
I love you.

01:04:49.668 --> 01:04:50.712
Come.

01:04:53.977 --> 01:04:55.326
Give me your leg.

01:04:57.197 --> 01:04:58.851
Go. Go!

01:05:05.597 --> 01:05:07.077
So...

01:05:10.428 --> 01:05:11.864
What's your name?

01:05:14.693 --> 01:05:17.217
I'm Ravi. I'm a doctor.

01:05:18.479 --> 01:05:21.918
Because... more men die
of infected wounds

01:05:22.092 --> 01:05:24.616
than out there, in the arena.

01:05:26.052 --> 01:05:28.837
This needs to be cleaned,
it needs to be stitched and

01:05:29.012 --> 01:05:31.579
it is going to hurt.

01:05:31.753 --> 01:05:32.885
Mm.

01:05:33.059 --> 01:05:36.062
This is Devil's Breath
and opium.

01:05:36.715 --> 01:05:38.195
It's for the pain.

01:05:39.196 --> 01:05:40.893
You should breathe in.

01:05:46.899 --> 01:05:48.335
I've been here
so long now,

01:05:48.509 --> 01:05:50.903
I don't even notice anymore.

01:05:51.077 --> 01:05:53.775
I've done more amputations
than I can count.

01:05:54.994 --> 01:05:57.518
Where'd you
- learn your trade?
- Why do you ask?

01:05:57.692 --> 01:05:59.303
You've got a heavy hand.

01:06:00.739 --> 01:06:02.132
I used to be
a gladiator myself.

01:06:02.306 --> 01:06:03.611
Ah.

01:06:03.785 --> 01:06:05.787
And would you have bested me?

01:06:05.962 --> 01:06:07.441
In your prime, of course.

01:06:08.660 --> 01:06:11.271
In your current state,
I could best you now.

01:06:13.143 --> 01:06:16.276
Luckily for you,
I have put down my sword.

01:06:16.450 --> 01:06:18.583
So now I spend my days

01:06:18.757 --> 01:06:21.238
saving lives
instead of taking them.

01:06:22.848 --> 01:06:25.285
And why such a change
so late in life?

01:06:26.199 --> 01:06:28.332
What we do in life

01:06:28.506 --> 01:06:30.856
echoes in eternity.

01:06:34.599 --> 01:06:36.166
I feel like
I know those words.

01:06:36.340 --> 01:06:38.820
I can't take credit.

01:06:38.995 --> 01:06:41.475
It's written on
one of the tombs.

01:06:41.649 --> 01:06:44.261
Over the bones of a gladiator.

01:06:44.435 --> 01:06:45.653
[Macrinus] My champion!

01:06:45.827 --> 01:06:47.916
I smell Devil's Breath!

01:06:50.441 --> 01:06:53.792
My... champion.

01:06:54.793 --> 01:06:56.490
Did you hear that crowd?

01:06:59.537 --> 01:07:01.713
- Did you hear that crowd?
- Mm-hm.

01:07:03.280 --> 01:07:05.804
You have something.
I knew it from the start.

01:07:05.978 --> 01:07:09.808
- Did you now?
- Yes. The Greeks call it...

01:07:10.591 --> 01:07:12.071
<i>thymos.</i>

01:07:12.245 --> 01:07:13.551
Smoke.

01:07:14.291 --> 01:07:15.640
Rage.

01:07:16.641 --> 01:07:18.686
That rage is your gift.

01:07:19.383 --> 01:07:22.125
Like the great Achilles.

01:07:22.299 --> 01:07:24.562
Never let it go.

01:07:24.736 --> 01:07:27.478
It will carry you
to greatness,

01:07:27.652 --> 01:07:29.436
my champion.

01:07:48.890 --> 01:07:50.892
Thank you

01:07:51.067 --> 01:07:52.938
for inviting me.

01:07:53.112 --> 01:07:55.071
This is truly an honor.

01:08:00.206 --> 01:08:02.034
I hear you are
the talk of the court.

01:08:04.428 --> 01:08:05.429
Yes.

01:08:06.343 --> 01:08:07.779
We've met before.

01:08:08.519 --> 01:08:10.521
- Have we?
- Long ago.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:13.524
Where?

01:08:13.698 --> 01:08:15.526
I was in the service
of your father's army

01:08:15.700 --> 01:08:17.702
on his African campaign.

01:08:18.964 --> 01:08:20.966
You served
with my father?

01:08:24.665 --> 01:08:25.797
Mm.

01:08:26.493 --> 01:08:28.495
I had the privilege

01:08:29.540 --> 01:08:31.063
of reading
his "Meditations."

01:08:31.237 --> 01:08:32.456
Mm.

01:08:35.459 --> 01:08:37.374
"The best revenge

01:08:38.549 --> 01:08:41.769
is to be unlike him
who performed the injury."

01:08:44.076 --> 01:08:46.557
I hear you've been
arming half the legions

01:08:46.731 --> 01:08:51.736
in the entire empire,
and here, now, in Rome...

01:08:53.085 --> 01:08:55.957
you're gaining influence
by sponsoring gladiators.

01:08:56.132 --> 01:08:58.134
I do it for the love
of the sport.

01:08:58.308 --> 01:09:01.267
And where did you find
these gladiators?

01:09:02.268 --> 01:09:05.010
They're usually
prisoners of war.

01:09:05.967 --> 01:09:09.362
Or vagrants.
Why do you ask?

01:09:09.536 --> 01:09:12.235
A man can choose to fight...

01:09:14.150 --> 01:09:15.760
and stay alive.

01:09:15.934 --> 01:09:19.024
It's the same in life as it is
in the arena, is it not?

01:09:21.505 --> 01:09:23.071
Who is this?

01:09:23.246 --> 01:09:25.596
That is my father
as a youth.

01:09:28.816 --> 01:09:29.991
<i>She had a child?</i>

01:09:30.166 --> 01:09:31.863
Mm.

01:09:32.037 --> 01:09:34.344
It's common knowledge.
When Commodus was killed,

01:09:34.518 --> 01:09:36.259
- the boy disappeared.
- Mm.

01:09:36.433 --> 01:09:38.391
- But who would care?
- Lucilla would care.

01:09:38.565 --> 01:09:41.177
- More wine!
- More wine!

01:09:42.569 --> 01:09:46.051
He was of the royal bloodline,
after all.

01:09:47.792 --> 01:09:49.054
And his father?

01:09:49.228 --> 01:09:53.885
Ostensibly,
Lucius Verus.

01:09:54.059 --> 01:09:55.713
See, it was
an arranged marriage.

01:09:55.887 --> 01:09:56.931
She was 14.

01:09:57.105 --> 01:10:00.370
- Mm.
- Females were not his taste.

01:10:00.544 --> 01:10:01.806
- Nor mine, some days.
- Nor yours!

01:10:03.590 --> 01:10:07.725
No, no, no.
By rumor, you see,
she took lovers.

01:10:07.899 --> 01:10:12.033
And by rumor,
the real father...
was Commodus.

01:10:13.034 --> 01:10:15.385
Brotherly love,
- you see?
- Yeah.

01:10:15.559 --> 01:10:17.213
If he died,

01:10:18.257 --> 01:10:20.607
- there has to be remains.
- Mm.

01:10:20.781 --> 01:10:24.045
And if he lived,
that would make him about...

01:10:24.220 --> 01:10:26.222
Um, well,
let's work it out.

01:10:26.396 --> 01:10:29.703
He was about 12
- when he died?
- Yes.

01:10:29.877 --> 01:10:34.142
So that would make him...

01:11:09.787 --> 01:11:10.614
My lady.

01:11:11.267 --> 01:11:12.137
Gracchus.

01:11:13.269 --> 01:11:15.140
- Please come.
- Thank you.

01:11:33.941 --> 01:11:35.291
Gladiator...

01:11:36.857 --> 01:11:37.815
do you know me?

01:11:46.258 --> 01:11:47.564
Do you have a family?

01:11:50.088 --> 01:11:53.309
A wife. Arishat.

01:11:54.875 --> 01:11:56.268
Arishat.

01:11:56.442 --> 01:11:59.619
She was killed
under your husband's command.

01:12:02.405 --> 01:12:04.494
Rome drowns
in its own blood.

01:12:04.668 --> 01:12:06.931
And yet you enjoy
the pleasures of the Colosseum.

01:12:08.280 --> 01:12:11.109
There is much
you do not understand.

01:12:17.898 --> 01:12:18.986
Lucius.

01:12:19.160 --> 01:12:21.162
I do not know
who you think I am.

01:12:23.556 --> 01:12:25.384
My name is Hanno,

01:12:25.558 --> 01:12:27.952
and I have no mother,
or none that I can remember.

01:12:34.698 --> 01:12:36.656
I'm so sorry.

01:12:36.830 --> 01:12:38.832
If your son were here,
I feel sure he would tell you

01:12:39.006 --> 01:12:40.834
not to grieve him.

01:12:41.008 --> 01:12:42.662
For he would not be the boy
that you sent away.

01:12:42.836 --> 01:12:44.795
That boy is dead.

01:12:47.232 --> 01:12:49.321
You may think
I have little worth.

01:12:50.975 --> 01:12:52.977
You may think
I betrayed you.

01:12:54.979 --> 01:12:56.720
But I need you to know...

01:12:58.199 --> 01:13:01.072
if you will not have
your mother's love,

01:13:01.246 --> 01:13:04.075
then take
your father's strength.

01:13:05.293 --> 01:13:06.643
You need it.

01:13:08.993 --> 01:13:13.171
His name was
Maximus Decimus Meridius.

01:13:14.564 --> 01:13:15.956
And I see him in you.

01:13:16.130 --> 01:13:17.480
Get out.

01:13:19.656 --> 01:13:22.093
My lady, we must go at once!

01:13:25.575 --> 01:13:27.925
Lucius, you were loved

01:13:28.099 --> 01:13:31.145
by myself
and by your father.

01:13:32.451 --> 01:13:33.800
Your name
was on his lips--

01:13:33.974 --> 01:13:35.759
Get out!

01:14:01.828 --> 01:14:03.700
Lucius is alive.

01:14:06.093 --> 01:14:07.791
Are you certain?

01:14:07.965 --> 01:14:09.270
Yes.

01:14:10.228 --> 01:14:11.534
I know my son.

01:14:14.624 --> 01:14:16.452
I spoke to him
tonight.

01:14:19.890 --> 01:14:22.936
He may be lost to me
for what I did,

01:14:24.198 --> 01:14:25.852
but he lives.

01:14:27.114 --> 01:14:29.639
The third day of the games
is tomorrow.

01:14:29.813 --> 01:14:31.292
Most fighters won't survive.

01:14:31.467 --> 01:14:32.816
Acacius,

01:14:34.208 --> 01:14:35.688
you must help him.

01:14:36.559 --> 01:14:38.430
Help him?[crying] Yes.

01:14:40.954 --> 01:14:43.435
I failed him then.

01:14:44.001 --> 01:14:45.481
I know I did.

01:14:47.308 --> 01:14:49.441
I cannot fail him now.

01:14:52.096 --> 01:14:53.445
The army is in Ostia.

01:14:53.619 --> 01:14:56.317
If we wait a few days...

01:14:56.492 --> 01:14:58.494
He could be dead
by then.

01:15:00.583 --> 01:15:01.845
Acacius,

01:15:02.019 --> 01:15:05.588
I would willingly
give my life for Rome,

01:15:06.806 --> 01:15:09.200
but I will not
give my son's.

01:15:15.423 --> 01:15:17.643
And one.

01:15:18.514 --> 01:15:20.254
And two.

01:15:20.428 --> 01:15:23.040
And one.

01:15:23.214 --> 01:15:26.043
Together.
Timing, timing, timing!

01:15:27.348 --> 01:15:30.395
And one. And two.

01:15:31.048 --> 01:15:32.963
And one.

01:15:33.137 --> 01:15:35.008
Pause, pause!

01:15:37.881 --> 01:15:39.056
We won't get far
like this.

01:15:40.840 --> 01:15:43.147
Just him. You go.

01:15:43.321 --> 01:15:45.018
Go!

01:15:45.192 --> 01:15:48.587
Let's see how far you can go
on your own without your team.

01:15:50.328 --> 01:15:51.764
Ready?

01:15:51.938 --> 01:15:53.157
One!

01:15:54.071 --> 01:15:54.941
And two!

01:15:55.115 --> 01:15:57.161
Timing, timing!

01:15:57.901 --> 01:15:59.250
Come on, more!

01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:06.083
More!

01:16:23.013 --> 01:16:24.144
Leave him.

01:16:43.120 --> 01:16:46.514
It's just vinegar,
my friend.

01:16:48.560 --> 01:16:50.997
There will be
no more opium for you.

01:16:52.390 --> 01:16:56.002
There is plenty of pain waiting
for you in the next life.

01:16:56.176 --> 01:16:59.484
I don't know why
you are so greedy for it
in this one.

01:17:04.228 --> 01:17:05.577
Are you a free man, Ravi?

01:17:05.751 --> 01:17:07.579
"Free."

01:17:09.276 --> 01:17:11.627
I am. Mm.

01:17:11.801 --> 01:17:13.280
I laid down my sword

01:17:13.454 --> 01:17:15.369
and I swore never
to pick it up again.

01:17:15.543 --> 01:17:16.980
And yet
you choose this hell?

01:17:17.154 --> 01:17:18.721
Mm-hm.

01:17:18.895 --> 01:17:20.200
What was your home before?

01:17:21.462 --> 01:17:22.812
Varanasi.

01:17:22.986 --> 01:17:25.162
And why don't you go back?

01:17:25.336 --> 01:17:26.729
I wish I could.

01:17:26.903 --> 01:17:28.600
But...

01:17:31.168 --> 01:17:33.170
I met a woman.
Ah.

01:17:34.084 --> 01:17:36.434
- It's always a woman.
- Always.

01:17:36.608 --> 01:17:40.438
She is from Londinium.
Britannia. You know.

01:17:40.612 --> 01:17:42.396
So now...

01:17:42.570 --> 01:17:45.443
our sons,
they speak only Latin.

01:17:45.617 --> 01:17:47.924
My daughter's eyes,
they are as blue as yours.

01:17:50.709 --> 01:17:52.232
We are Romans now.

01:17:52.406 --> 01:17:56.019
I grew up hearing stories
at my grandfather's knee.

01:17:57.237 --> 01:18:00.545
He used to talk
of the dream that was Rome.

01:18:02.895 --> 01:18:06.769
It was so fragile,
you could only whisper it...

01:18:09.119 --> 01:18:10.860
or it would vanish.

01:18:11.774 --> 01:18:13.210
So,

01:18:13.384 --> 01:18:14.994
what was this dream?

01:18:15.168 --> 01:18:19.651
A Rome where all could live
under fair law and be protected.

01:18:20.608 --> 01:18:22.480
A Rome of the Senate.

01:18:24.134 --> 01:18:25.657
A Rome of hope.

01:18:28.791 --> 01:18:33.012
Your grandfather,
he sounds like
a dangerous man.

01:18:33.186 --> 01:18:34.405
Hm.

01:18:37.147 --> 01:18:39.279
The odds are against you.

01:18:41.673 --> 01:18:43.675
The odds
are always against me.

01:18:44.632 --> 01:18:45.764
Don't worry, old man.

01:18:45.938 --> 01:18:47.679
Eh?

01:18:51.248 --> 01:18:53.380
You should
- get some rest. Hm?
- Mm.

01:18:54.512 --> 01:18:56.906
Your men will need you
to lead them tomorrow.

01:19:13.270 --> 01:19:14.967
This is about survival.

01:19:16.099 --> 01:19:17.404
Survive!

01:19:17.578 --> 01:19:21.278
In the name of Poseidon,

01:19:21.452 --> 01:19:25.543
we celebrate the glory
of naval war.

01:19:25.717 --> 01:19:27.371
They have archers.

01:19:27.545 --> 01:19:29.895
Be ready.
Listen for my commands.

01:19:30.069 --> 01:19:32.724
Stay together
and pull as one, yes?

01:19:32.898 --> 01:19:33.681
Yes!

01:19:33.856 --> 01:19:36.162
- Yes?
- Yes!

01:19:43.039 --> 01:19:45.693
Today we relive

01:19:45.868 --> 01:19:49.306
the Battle of Salamis!

01:19:50.698 --> 01:19:55.225
The Trojans
versus the Persians!

01:19:59.795 --> 01:20:01.361
Oars out![all] Oars!

01:20:02.145 --> 01:20:04.190
And... pull!

01:20:23.862 --> 01:20:25.821
Archers!

01:20:25.995 --> 01:20:26.865
Archers!

01:20:29.041 --> 01:20:30.042
Pull!

01:20:38.964 --> 01:20:40.618
Pull!

01:20:43.447 --> 01:20:44.448
Pull!

01:20:57.722 --> 01:21:00.072
Pull! To my time!

01:21:00.856 --> 01:21:02.118
And... now!

01:21:04.772 --> 01:21:07.079
Left side! Ready, and

01:21:07.253 --> 01:21:09.125
ship oars now!

01:21:09.299 --> 01:21:11.344
Oars in! Oars in!

01:21:12.868 --> 01:21:13.738
Get down!

01:21:29.928 --> 01:21:33.801
And pull! And pull!

01:21:36.674 --> 01:21:38.763
Don't stop!

01:21:41.113 --> 01:21:42.288
Pull!

01:21:44.943 --> 01:21:46.336
And right!

01:21:51.994 --> 01:21:53.386
Ready to ram!

01:21:55.649 --> 01:21:58.130
And brace! Brace!

01:22:38.214 --> 01:22:39.606
Everyone regroup!

01:23:15.903 --> 01:23:17.905
Praetorians!

01:23:19.255 --> 01:23:21.648
Hanno! Hanno! Hanno!

01:23:21.822 --> 01:23:22.693
Move, move.

01:23:29.700 --> 01:23:32.790
In the name of the emperors...

01:23:32.964 --> 01:23:37.534
the victor is Hanno!

01:23:49.241 --> 01:23:51.113
Who did this?

01:23:53.898 --> 01:23:56.118
Who did this?!

01:23:56.814 --> 01:23:58.946
- It was me!
- I did it!

01:23:59.121 --> 01:24:00.948
- I did it! I did it! I did it!
- It was me!

01:24:05.518 --> 01:24:07.607
Geta will want retribution
for all of you.

01:24:08.695 --> 01:24:09.870
Did you learn to shoot
in the same place

01:24:10.045 --> 01:24:11.437
you learned to recite poetry?

01:24:11.611 --> 01:24:12.699
Be glad it wasn't me,

01:24:12.873 --> 01:24:14.136
or that arrow
would have found you.

01:24:30.021 --> 01:24:31.457
Be seated.

01:24:33.981 --> 01:24:35.374
I have news for you.

01:24:39.900 --> 01:24:41.337
He's here, sir.

01:24:44.514 --> 01:24:46.472
Oh, still here.

01:24:48.648 --> 01:24:49.997
Macrinus.

01:24:50.172 --> 01:24:52.261
Welcome.

01:24:53.871 --> 01:24:56.091
Yes, I'm listening.

01:24:56.265 --> 01:24:58.789
You know
this is my house now.

01:24:58.963 --> 01:25:01.183
Your debt to me is
over 10,000 denarii.

01:25:01.357 --> 01:25:02.662
You know that.

01:25:02.836 --> 01:25:05.361
I have other things. Uh...

01:25:05.535 --> 01:25:07.232
Cattle. Art!

01:25:07.406 --> 01:25:08.929
Truth, then.

01:25:09.104 --> 01:25:10.627
What do you... want?

01:25:10.801 --> 01:25:13.412
Truth.
That's what I want.

01:25:13.586 --> 01:25:17.982
Nothing happens in Rome
without your knowledge.

01:25:19.157 --> 01:25:21.159
You have
the senators' trust.

01:25:22.029 --> 01:25:24.162
You have
Lucilla's trust.

01:25:24.336 --> 01:25:26.991
More importantly,
you have my trust.

01:25:29.036 --> 01:25:32.910
You wish my... loyalty?

01:25:33.084 --> 01:25:34.738
I own...

01:25:36.174 --> 01:25:37.958
your house.

01:25:38.133 --> 01:25:40.744
I want your loyalty.

01:25:44.530 --> 01:25:45.923
I...

01:25:47.142 --> 01:25:48.839
- Tell me.
- I have heard...

01:25:49.013 --> 01:25:51.668
of a plot...

01:25:52.582 --> 01:25:55.193
- to dethrone the emperors.
- Yes.

01:25:55.367 --> 01:25:57.761
But the plan
has been delayed, uh...

01:25:57.935 --> 01:26:00.981
A gladiator is to be rescued
from the arena.

01:26:01.156 --> 01:26:02.505
- Tonight.
- Mm.

01:26:02.679 --> 01:26:05.769
- I don't know why.
- I know why. I know who.

01:26:08.163 --> 01:26:09.207
Pack.

01:26:12.863 --> 01:26:14.386
Quickly.

01:26:42.327 --> 01:26:43.415
[man] Open up!

01:27:03.566 --> 01:27:05.524
Open for
the emperors' guard!

01:27:33.073 --> 01:27:36.512
My Lady, come with us.

01:28:21.905 --> 01:28:24.081
Thanks to the civic virtue

01:28:24.255 --> 01:28:26.823
of men like Thraex
and Macrinus,

01:28:28.128 --> 01:28:29.826
your insurrection

01:28:30.566 --> 01:28:32.481
has been revealed.

01:28:34.396 --> 01:28:35.701
The honor,

01:28:36.833 --> 01:28:40.663
the dignitas that Rome
has bestowed upon you...

01:28:43.187 --> 01:28:46.146
all this you have forfeited
by your treachery.

01:28:46.321 --> 01:28:48.279
Please, Emperor Geta.

01:28:48.975 --> 01:28:50.803
Torture me if you want,

01:28:51.761 --> 01:28:53.066
but do not lecture me.

01:28:53.240 --> 01:28:56.635
Your name
will be forgotten!

01:28:57.767 --> 01:29:00.770
Lost... to history.

01:29:02.772 --> 01:29:04.077
You are damned,
General.

01:29:06.906 --> 01:29:08.821
- You laugh.
- You damn me?

01:29:09.996 --> 01:29:11.650
I don't care.

01:29:11.824 --> 01:29:15.219
Everything is forgotten in time.
Empires fall. So do emperors.

01:29:15.393 --> 01:29:17.047
Why wait?

01:29:17.221 --> 01:29:20.311
- I will gut him right now!
- No, no, no!

01:29:20.485 --> 01:29:23.706
Let them be. Come! Come!

01:29:23.880 --> 01:29:25.621
His death must be public.

01:29:25.795 --> 01:29:27.231
Public?

01:29:27.405 --> 01:29:30.147
Hang his entrails
from the city gates!

01:29:30.321 --> 01:29:31.888
And crucify her!

01:29:32.628 --> 01:29:34.020
Crucify her!

01:29:34.194 --> 01:29:36.066
Take them away!

01:29:36.240 --> 01:29:39.548
[Geta] Shh! Shh! Shh!

01:29:52.735 --> 01:29:53.866
Thank you, Macrinus.

01:30:00.220 --> 01:30:01.526
Come on.

01:30:05.008 --> 01:30:06.792
In these last days,

01:30:06.966 --> 01:30:10.100
I have come to think of you
not as a subject

01:30:10.274 --> 01:30:12.407
but as a true friend.

01:30:12.581 --> 01:30:14.191
Thank you.

01:30:14.365 --> 01:30:16.933
Thank you so much.
But as a friend,

01:30:17.107 --> 01:30:19.762
I must counsel caution.

01:30:19.936 --> 01:30:22.895
Acacius is a hero of Rome.

01:30:23.766 --> 01:30:27.160
Crucifixion
is for thieves.

01:30:27.334 --> 01:30:28.466
Christians.

01:30:29.641 --> 01:30:32.514
- It's too common.
- He is a traitor.
He must die.

01:30:32.688 --> 01:30:33.993
I agree.

01:30:34.167 --> 01:30:39.869
Let the gods decide
his fate in the Colosseum.

01:30:46.266 --> 01:30:47.877
Let the gods decide.

01:30:50.749 --> 01:30:54.710
You know, last night I woke,
dreaming of a dark river.

01:30:56.320 --> 01:30:58.148
This time,
for the first time,

01:30:58.322 --> 01:30:59.802
I was crossing it.

01:31:00.629 --> 01:31:02.239
Hm.

01:31:02.413 --> 01:31:04.807
Well, you know,
where I come from,

01:31:04.981 --> 01:31:07.897
crossing a river,
it represents forgiveness.

01:31:08.071 --> 01:31:10.987
Represents... salvation.

01:31:11.161 --> 01:31:14.120
Where I come from,
it means
you're already dead.

01:31:22.520 --> 01:31:25.001
But as I saw it,
I was not afraid.

01:31:26.742 --> 01:31:28.352
For...

01:31:28.526 --> 01:31:31.355
For someone was waiting
for me on the other side.

01:31:33.009 --> 01:31:34.706
There.

01:31:45.021 --> 01:31:46.501
Who is this man?

01:31:47.893 --> 01:31:49.329
Scratched out?

01:31:50.243 --> 01:31:52.289
Maximus.

01:31:55.074 --> 01:31:57.033
I saw him fight once.

01:31:58.121 --> 01:31:59.644
- He was magnificent.
- Mm.

01:31:59.818 --> 01:32:02.691
Yeah. My time in the arena,
it was after his,

01:32:02.865 --> 01:32:06.999
but many still talked of him
in whispers, you know?

01:32:07.173 --> 01:32:09.393
Spoke of him.

01:32:10.176 --> 01:32:11.830
What he did.

01:32:12.004 --> 01:32:13.876
I met him once.

01:32:15.704 --> 01:32:17.227
He was kind.

01:32:19.534 --> 01:32:21.405
He bowed to no one.

01:32:24.887 --> 01:32:26.453
Come with me.

01:32:26.628 --> 01:32:29.631
- Hmm?
- Come. With me.

01:32:48.780 --> 01:32:52.871
When a rebel gladiator dies,
we bury them here.

01:32:53.045 --> 01:32:57.441
"What we do in life
echoes in eternity."

01:33:15.154 --> 01:33:16.939
This is Argento.

01:33:17.113 --> 01:33:18.593
This is Scatto.

01:33:59.024 --> 01:34:00.635
Cheers.

01:34:01.331 --> 01:34:02.724
And stop.

01:34:04.421 --> 01:34:08.425
For his treason
against the lives

01:34:08.599 --> 01:34:12.559
of the emperors
and the Roman state,

01:34:12.734 --> 01:34:16.085
General Justus Acacius,

01:34:17.521 --> 01:34:20.437
an enemy of the people!

01:34:20.611 --> 01:34:23.005
Acacius! Acacius! Acacius!

01:34:23.179 --> 01:34:25.529
-  We love you, Acacius!
- You are a hero!

01:34:26.835 --> 01:34:29.838
Acacius! Acacius! Acacius!

01:35:01.347 --> 01:35:03.959
<i>Vae victis.</i>[soldiers] General.

01:35:26.068 --> 01:35:27.983
Acacius!

01:35:29.245 --> 01:35:33.379
Acacius! Acacius! Acacius!

01:35:39.429 --> 01:35:43.433
From the vanquished city
of Numidia,

01:35:44.651 --> 01:35:49.787
the victor of two conquests
in the Colosseum...

01:35:49.961 --> 01:35:52.485
Go now. <i>Vae victis.</i>

01:35:56.838 --> 01:35:59.579
Hanno! Hanno! Hanno!

01:35:59.754 --> 01:36:02.017
Hanno!

01:36:02.191 --> 01:36:04.933
Oh, Lord, any honor I have,

01:36:05.107 --> 01:36:06.717
- I will give it to you!
- It's too late.

01:36:06.891 --> 01:36:10.068
The Roman traitor or

01:36:10.242 --> 01:36:12.505
the barbarian hero.

01:36:13.289 --> 01:36:14.986
Let the gods decide.

01:36:15.160 --> 01:36:16.814
Lucius... wait.

01:36:18.337 --> 01:36:19.469
Wait! Wait!

01:36:29.522 --> 01:36:32.264
I am a vessel.

01:36:33.613 --> 01:36:35.833
Fill me with vengeance

01:36:36.834 --> 01:36:39.054
and vanquish the betrayer.

01:36:56.898 --> 01:36:59.161
- We love you, Acacius!
- Move it!

01:37:03.295 --> 01:37:04.862
Pick it up!

01:37:05.036 --> 01:37:07.343
Bravo, Hanno!

01:37:07.517 --> 01:37:08.866
We love you, Acacius!

01:37:09.040 --> 01:37:09.954
What are you waiting for?

01:37:10.128 --> 01:37:11.086
You will die!

01:37:42.160 --> 01:37:43.422
I know who you are.

01:37:45.250 --> 01:37:47.252
Lucius Verus Aurelius.

01:38:00.613 --> 01:38:02.572
Acacius
has raised his hand!

01:38:03.616 --> 01:38:05.836
He has surrendered.

01:38:13.496 --> 01:38:15.454
Let the gods decide.

01:38:33.081 --> 01:38:35.910
The gods have rendered
their judgment.

01:38:39.043 --> 01:38:40.523
Do what you must.

01:38:41.654 --> 01:38:44.005
But on my death,
you have to know...

01:38:45.920 --> 01:38:47.834
I love your mother,
Lucilla.

01:38:49.314 --> 01:38:50.663
And your father...

01:38:53.449 --> 01:38:54.450
Maximus.

01:38:55.799 --> 01:38:57.844
I would have died
for him.

01:38:58.019 --> 01:38:59.803
Kill him!

01:38:59.977 --> 01:39:02.675
Let him live!
Please!

01:39:03.807 --> 01:39:06.853
Live! Live! Live! Live!

01:39:13.817 --> 01:39:15.514
Kill him!

01:39:17.516 --> 01:39:18.343
[Geta] Kill him!

01:39:18.517 --> 01:39:19.692
Archers!

01:39:19.866 --> 01:39:21.651
No![Geta] Kill him!

01:39:21.825 --> 01:39:24.262
Acacius! Acacius!

01:39:24.436 --> 01:39:26.047
Kill him!

01:39:26.221 --> 01:39:27.570
Kill him!

01:39:27.744 --> 01:39:29.093
Kill him! Kill him!

01:39:31.356 --> 01:39:32.662
Acacius!

01:39:42.802 --> 01:39:43.803
No!

01:39:44.413 --> 01:39:45.849
No!

01:39:46.023 --> 01:39:47.633
Acacius!

01:39:50.201 --> 01:39:52.116
Damn you!

01:39:54.118 --> 01:39:55.990
Death will be
too good for you!

01:40:01.560 --> 01:40:04.694
Is this how Rome
treats its heroes?

01:40:08.698 --> 01:40:10.178
Tell me!

01:40:12.354 --> 01:40:16.793
If his life has no value,
what are yours worth?

01:40:16.967 --> 01:40:21.928
The gods have spoken!

01:40:35.986 --> 01:40:39.598
Hanno! Hanno! Hanno! Hanno!

01:40:55.092 --> 01:40:58.052
For our own safety,
we should return to the palace.

01:41:06.451 --> 01:41:09.628
Hanno! Hanno! Hanno!

01:41:19.377 --> 01:41:21.727
Stay back! Stay back!

01:42:09.993 --> 01:42:14.345
Arishat!

01:42:31.928 --> 01:42:33.451
We had a bargain.

01:42:37.151 --> 01:42:40.328
I gave him to you.
You let him live.

01:42:40.502 --> 01:42:42.112
And you got
what you wanted.

01:42:42.286 --> 01:42:44.810
I always get what I want.
Why did you let him live?

01:42:44.984 --> 01:42:47.813
You bought a gladiator,
not a slave.

01:42:49.554 --> 01:42:51.295
My will is my own.

01:42:53.558 --> 01:42:54.864
Ah...

01:42:55.038 --> 01:42:57.649
How blue is your blood?

01:42:57.823 --> 01:43:00.304
Perhaps the heart of a Roman

01:43:00.478 --> 01:43:02.698
beats in that chest.

01:43:08.399 --> 01:43:11.185
The greatest temple
Rome ever built.

01:43:11.359 --> 01:43:12.838
The Colosseum.

01:43:13.012 --> 01:43:15.232
Because this is
what they believe in.

01:43:15.406 --> 01:43:16.973
Power.

01:43:17.147 --> 01:43:19.758
They gather here to watch
the strong strike down the weak.

01:43:19.932 --> 01:43:21.717
There has to be
- something else.
- There is nothing else.

01:43:21.891 --> 01:43:24.633
There has to be
- another Rome.
- There is no other Rome.

01:43:26.156 --> 01:43:27.679
- The "dream"?
- Mm.

01:43:27.853 --> 01:43:29.681
The dream of Rome?

01:43:29.855 --> 01:43:31.335
It's an old man's fantasy.

01:43:33.163 --> 01:43:34.512
Who are you?

01:43:37.646 --> 01:43:40.605
What was your name
before you traded it
for a Roman one?

01:43:41.693 --> 01:43:43.129
You'll never know.

01:43:45.958 --> 01:43:47.525
I have a destiny.

01:43:51.050 --> 01:43:53.357
The gods delivered you to me.

01:43:56.404 --> 01:43:58.057
You will be my instrument.

01:43:58.232 --> 01:44:01.496
I will never be
your instrument,
in this life or the next.

01:44:09.808 --> 01:44:12.985
That will not be my destiny.

01:44:15.031 --> 01:44:16.598
But I will see your end.

01:44:37.706 --> 01:44:39.490
What else could I do?

01:44:39.664 --> 01:44:41.405
He and his bitch
were plotting to kill us.

01:44:41.579 --> 01:44:44.147
Don't you hear them?
They're calling for our heads!

01:44:44.321 --> 01:44:46.280
The Praetorians
will put down this crowd.

01:44:46.454 --> 01:44:48.107
- Like they have every other.
- You brought this on us.

01:44:48.282 --> 01:44:50.675
Filthy ape!

01:44:54.375 --> 01:44:57.029
Perhaps you should, uh,

01:44:57.203 --> 01:45:01.512
take Dondus elsewhere
to comfort him?

01:45:11.130 --> 01:45:13.350
Forgive
my brother's outburst.

01:45:15.309 --> 01:45:16.745
The disease
that infects his loins

01:45:16.919 --> 01:45:18.790
has spread to his brain.

01:45:18.964 --> 01:45:21.967
- Every day he gets worse.
- I will reason with him.

01:45:38.332 --> 01:45:41.378
I see you.

01:45:41.552 --> 01:45:43.554
I see you.

01:45:44.990 --> 01:45:47.079
Caracalla, Caracalla!

01:45:47.253 --> 01:45:48.820
Come on, stand up.

01:45:48.994 --> 01:45:50.996
Get up, get up.
Not you.

01:45:51.170 --> 01:45:52.911
All right,
there you go.

01:45:54.652 --> 01:45:56.915
Now, listen to me.

01:45:57.089 --> 01:45:58.569
What's the matter?

01:45:58.743 --> 01:46:01.311
Nothing's ever mine.

01:46:01.485 --> 01:46:03.748
Everything is ours, always.

01:46:03.922 --> 01:46:07.099
Even in the womb...
he tried...

01:46:07.970 --> 01:46:11.234
to cut my umbilicus

01:46:11.408 --> 01:46:13.149
so that I couldn't have
any more air.

01:46:13.323 --> 01:46:15.499
You remember that,
- do you?
- Certainly.

01:46:15.673 --> 01:46:17.936
- Come, sit.
- One cannot forget.

01:46:18.110 --> 01:46:20.243
My conscience compels me.

01:46:20.417 --> 01:46:21.766
What?

01:46:21.940 --> 01:46:23.072
Sit.

01:46:23.246 --> 01:46:24.595
Your brother

01:46:25.509 --> 01:46:26.989
means to blame you

01:46:28.033 --> 01:46:30.340
in front of
the entire Senate...

01:46:30.514 --> 01:46:31.820
But I did not do it!

01:46:31.994 --> 01:46:33.474
...for what's happening
in the streets.

01:46:33.648 --> 01:46:35.954
- The chaos!
- He's lying!

01:46:36.128 --> 01:46:37.869
No testimony
can be more damning

01:46:38.043 --> 01:46:41.395
than one brother
against another.

01:46:41.569 --> 01:46:44.136
That's a lie!
He always lies!

01:46:44.310 --> 01:46:46.704
He can be very persuasive.

01:46:46.878 --> 01:46:49.533
So?
What will they do to me?

01:46:49.707 --> 01:46:52.362
Oh, I don't dare imagine.
But imagine this:

01:46:52.536 --> 01:46:54.538
What will they do to Dondus?

01:46:57.715 --> 01:47:00.457
What will they do

01:47:00.631 --> 01:47:01.937
to Dondus?

01:47:04.374 --> 01:47:05.636
It's your decision.

01:47:43.500 --> 01:47:44.370
Brother.

01:47:48.026 --> 01:47:49.724
Put down the blade.

01:47:49.898 --> 01:47:50.942
You lie.

01:47:51.116 --> 01:47:52.814
- Give it to me.
- You always lie!

01:47:52.988 --> 01:47:53.858
Give it--

01:47:57.862 --> 01:48:00.038
Look at me.
Look at me. Look at me.

01:48:00.212 --> 01:48:02.519
- Lie!
- Listen to me.
Break the spell.

01:48:02.693 --> 01:48:04.652
- Lie!
- Break the spell!

01:48:04.826 --> 01:48:07.916
I've always protected you.
Because I love you.

01:48:08.612 --> 01:48:10.614
Come back. Help me.

01:48:33.289 --> 01:48:34.638
Lucius.

01:48:56.442 --> 01:48:58.967
Never could have imagined
the fates would lead us here.

01:49:01.186 --> 01:49:02.927
And yet here we are.

01:49:04.668 --> 01:49:06.322
Everything has
brought us full circle.

01:49:06.496 --> 01:49:09.499
You sent me away
and yet fate

01:49:09.673 --> 01:49:12.110
brought me back
to the very ground
where he died.

01:49:15.157 --> 01:49:16.114
This ring...

01:49:18.029 --> 01:49:19.683
belonged to my father.

01:49:23.818 --> 01:49:26.777
He gave it
to your father,
Maximus,

01:49:26.951 --> 01:49:28.779
as a token of trust.

01:49:30.215 --> 01:49:33.175
I gave it to Acacius
for his valor.

01:49:37.701 --> 01:49:39.877
This ring belonged to my wife.

01:49:42.880 --> 01:49:44.360
I shall wear it next to yours.

01:49:58.635 --> 01:50:01.072
I am truly sorry for Acacius.

01:50:02.421 --> 01:50:05.076
I could not see the man.

01:50:07.426 --> 01:50:09.254
He was a soldier of Rome.

01:50:11.256 --> 01:50:12.606
There was a plan.

01:50:13.911 --> 01:50:15.217
He was readying troops
at Ostia

01:50:15.391 --> 01:50:18.350
under the command
of Darius Sextus.

01:50:18.524 --> 01:50:21.527
Troops he was to lead
against the emperors.

01:50:23.617 --> 01:50:27.925
Acacius. Maximus.
Marcus Aurelius.

01:50:29.100 --> 01:50:31.450
They lived and died
for Rome.

01:50:32.190 --> 01:50:33.627
We all do.

01:50:35.716 --> 01:50:38.022
Is it true
they intend to kill you?

01:50:41.069 --> 01:50:42.984
One man or another
has had a sword
against my neck

01:50:43.158 --> 01:50:45.464
since the day
my father died.

01:50:48.729 --> 01:50:50.644
But now
that I've found you,

01:50:51.514 --> 01:50:53.298
it doesn't matter.

01:50:54.691 --> 01:50:56.388
I am not afraid.

01:50:56.562 --> 01:50:59.609
I've become well versed
in losing the things
that I love.

01:51:02.481 --> 01:51:03.657
But now that I've found you,

01:51:03.831 --> 01:51:05.484
I have no desire
to lose you again.

01:51:08.662 --> 01:51:10.838
- You stand like him.
- Mm.

01:51:11.621 --> 01:51:12.970
Alert.

01:51:13.884 --> 01:51:14.972
Proud.

01:51:17.235 --> 01:51:19.760
I do not have his strength.

01:51:20.717 --> 01:51:22.806
I wish that were true.

01:51:24.242 --> 01:51:27.289
I wish I were telling you
to flee this place.

01:51:36.167 --> 01:51:37.255
Go now.

01:51:45.568 --> 01:51:46.700
Strength and honor.

01:51:49.267 --> 01:51:50.878
Strength and honor.

01:52:03.586 --> 01:52:05.588
As Emperor,

01:52:05.762 --> 01:52:07.372
I have convened

01:52:08.373 --> 01:52:11.550
the Senate to appoint
my First Consul

01:52:11.725 --> 01:52:14.945
and bestow upon him the power
to administer the military

01:52:15.119 --> 01:52:18.340
and civic functions
of the Empire.

01:52:22.213 --> 01:52:23.562
I name...

01:52:24.694 --> 01:52:27.088
Citizen Dondus!

01:52:34.138 --> 01:52:35.749
Hail Dondus!

01:52:39.230 --> 01:52:40.710
Hail Dondus!

01:52:42.756 --> 01:52:45.323
- Hail Dondus.
- Hail Dondus!

01:52:45.497 --> 01:52:47.978
Hail Dondus!

01:52:52.243 --> 01:52:54.071
As Second Consul...

01:52:56.030 --> 01:52:57.509
I name...

01:52:59.903 --> 01:53:01.165
Citizen...

01:53:03.472 --> 01:53:04.865
Macrinus!

01:53:07.302 --> 01:53:08.912
Hail Macrinus!

01:53:09.086 --> 01:53:10.479
Hail Macrinus!

01:53:10.653 --> 01:53:12.568
Hail Macrinus!

01:53:14.439 --> 01:53:16.920
There will be
a triumphal parade
to celebrate.

01:53:17.094 --> 01:53:18.617
There will be games

01:53:19.401 --> 01:53:21.272
and mass executions.

01:53:24.536 --> 01:53:27.191
Long live the Empire!

01:53:28.802 --> 01:53:30.499
Long live the Empire!

01:53:30.673 --> 01:53:32.283
Long live the Empire!

01:53:38.681 --> 01:53:39.856
Sit down.

01:53:43.294 --> 01:53:45.949
I happen to have...

01:53:49.561 --> 01:53:53.217
with good fortune
and not a little skill...

01:53:54.958 --> 01:53:58.092
the remaining emperor's ear.

01:54:05.316 --> 01:54:07.579
I can speak logic to it...

01:54:12.367 --> 01:54:14.848
and tame the madness
in the street. But...

01:54:17.807 --> 01:54:19.417
to restore order...

01:54:21.506 --> 01:54:23.334
I must have power...

01:54:27.077 --> 01:54:29.079
and command

01:54:29.819 --> 01:54:31.777
over the Praetorian Army.

01:54:37.653 --> 01:54:39.394
Ballot...

01:54:41.570 --> 01:54:42.919
or hand?

01:54:45.095 --> 01:54:47.619
Aye![all] Aye!

01:54:50.927 --> 01:54:52.537
Your humble servant.

01:54:56.672 --> 01:54:58.195
Put your hands down.

01:55:00.894 --> 01:55:02.373
You can sit down.

01:55:15.952 --> 01:55:17.562
<i>Rome must fall.</i>

01:55:20.304 --> 01:55:22.306
I need only
give it a push.

01:55:25.396 --> 01:55:27.572
And after Rome falls...

01:55:28.530 --> 01:55:30.924
...what then?

01:55:33.056 --> 01:55:35.058
You are
your father's child.

01:55:37.104 --> 01:55:40.498
His dream of Rome
was never a dream.

01:55:40.672 --> 01:55:42.587
It was a fiction.

01:55:42.761 --> 01:55:45.025
"The best revenge is

01:55:45.199 --> 01:55:48.985
to become unlike the one
who did the injury."

01:55:49.159 --> 01:55:54.034
I have made myself
unlike your father.

01:55:54.208 --> 01:55:57.689
He spoke of dreams,
I speak of truth.

01:55:57.863 --> 01:56:00.257
And the only truth
in my Rome

01:56:01.867 --> 01:56:03.869
is the law
of the strongest.

01:56:06.176 --> 01:56:07.525
I was owned

01:56:09.005 --> 01:56:10.528
by an emperor.

01:56:13.531 --> 01:56:15.620
Now I control an empire.

01:56:16.708 --> 01:56:19.973
Where else but in Rome
can a man do that?

01:56:25.282 --> 01:56:29.765
Do you recognize
your father's mark on me?

01:56:34.596 --> 01:56:35.901
If there is anything

01:56:36.598 --> 01:56:37.991
you need...

01:56:39.731 --> 01:56:41.385
in these last hours,

01:56:42.386 --> 01:56:44.040
we will provide.

01:56:49.785 --> 01:56:52.483
Your death will clear my path
to the throne.

01:56:54.398 --> 01:56:57.314
Tomorrow
there will be games.

01:56:57.488 --> 01:56:59.055
And at them...

01:56:59.969 --> 01:57:01.666
I will prevail.

01:57:15.332 --> 01:57:16.812
Ravi!

01:57:23.427 --> 01:57:25.603
Can you get me a message
to Ostia by morning?

01:57:25.777 --> 01:57:27.431
What is in Ostia?

01:57:27.605 --> 01:57:29.042
There is an army.

01:57:31.305 --> 01:57:32.915
I'm asking you
to risk yourself, my friend,

01:57:33.089 --> 01:57:35.178
in the service
of something greater.

01:57:38.094 --> 01:57:39.487
Ride to Ostia.

01:57:40.792 --> 01:57:42.794
Take this ring
to General Darius Sextus.

01:57:42.968 --> 01:57:44.361
Are you listening?

01:57:45.014 --> 01:57:47.625
Darius Sextus.

01:57:47.799 --> 01:57:49.801
He will know it
as Acacius's ring.

01:57:52.761 --> 01:57:54.893
And, uh,

01:57:55.807 --> 01:57:57.157
who shall I say has

01:57:57.853 --> 01:57:59.507
sent me with this ring?

01:58:02.901 --> 01:58:05.208
I am Lucius Verus Aurelius.

01:58:06.470 --> 01:58:07.993
The Prince of Rome.

01:58:09.212 --> 01:58:10.648
Tell him
I am summoning the army

01:58:10.822 --> 01:58:13.086
to the defense
of a new Republic.

01:58:21.746 --> 01:58:22.878
- Should I trust you?
- Yes.

01:58:23.052 --> 01:58:25.098
Should I?Yes.

01:58:32.017 --> 01:58:34.716
Ravi! I need your keys.

01:58:40.809 --> 01:58:42.506
Thank you.

01:59:20.370 --> 01:59:22.807
Stop! Come back!

01:59:53.577 --> 01:59:54.709
Who gave you this?

01:59:55.710 --> 01:59:57.842
Lucius Verus Aurelius.

01:59:59.061 --> 02:00:00.280
The Prince of Rome.

02:00:53.463 --> 02:00:56.510
Must we kill Lucilla?

02:00:58.163 --> 02:01:01.906
Until she dies,
you will never know peace.

02:01:03.778 --> 02:01:04.822
Ever.

02:01:15.746 --> 02:01:18.271
The people love her.
Her death will incite the mob.

02:01:18.445 --> 02:01:20.925
If she dies and the streets
rise up in anger,

02:01:21.099 --> 02:01:22.492
I shall deliver them
Caracalla's head

02:01:22.666 --> 02:01:24.015
and the people
shall acclaim me.

02:01:24.189 --> 02:01:27.758
That, my friend,
is politics.

02:01:30.587 --> 02:01:32.415
- Shall we?
- Yes.

02:01:47.691 --> 02:01:49.780
Today will be
your last fight, champion.

02:01:50.912 --> 02:01:52.522
And our master
has bestowed on you...

02:01:54.916 --> 02:01:57.310
the wooden sword of freedom.

02:02:01.314 --> 02:02:03.272
But you have to
earn it first.

02:02:03.446 --> 02:02:05.753
Today, you're gonna
defend your mother.

02:02:28.689 --> 02:02:31.518
Wood or steel,
a point is still a point!

02:02:58.806 --> 02:03:00.329
Wait for me.

02:03:19.130 --> 02:03:20.828
In honor

02:03:21.002 --> 02:03:25.267
of the acclamation
of Emperor Caracalla,

02:03:25.441 --> 02:03:31.316
First Consul Dondus
and Second Consul Macrinus,

02:03:31.491 --> 02:03:35.973
and as punishment
for her conspiracy
against the empire,

02:03:36.147 --> 02:03:40.500
for her calumnies against
the emperor's imperial bloodline

02:03:40.674 --> 02:03:42.850
and for fomenting
military mutiny

02:03:43.024 --> 02:03:44.417
along with her husband,

02:03:44.591 --> 02:03:48.203
the queen will face
divine justice

02:03:48.377 --> 02:03:52.425
at the hands
of the Praetorian Guard.

02:04:16.927 --> 02:04:18.451
I am not a general.

02:04:20.148 --> 02:04:23.630
But we are all soldiers.

02:04:25.632 --> 02:04:27.372
And up until now,

02:04:27.547 --> 02:04:31.725
we have fought for nothing more
than another day's survival.

02:04:31.899 --> 02:04:33.727
What will you
have us do?

02:04:35.076 --> 02:04:36.251
Well, you can return
to your cells

02:04:36.425 --> 02:04:38.340
if you do not wish
to fight this battle.

02:04:38.514 --> 02:04:40.821
Or...

02:04:42.562 --> 02:04:43.911
you can join me.

02:04:45.216 --> 02:04:47.523
And fight for a freedom
far beyond these walls.

02:04:47.697 --> 02:04:49.220
Aye!

02:04:49.394 --> 02:04:53.529
There once was a time when
honor meant something in Rome.

02:04:55.226 --> 02:04:56.750
In this Rome

02:04:57.664 --> 02:04:59.753
I no longer believe
that exists.

02:04:59.927 --> 02:05:01.842
We must find it!

02:05:04.192 --> 02:05:05.846
And know this:

02:05:07.195 --> 02:05:10.938
Where death is, we are not.

02:05:12.940 --> 02:05:14.855
Where we are,

02:05:15.595 --> 02:05:17.335
death is not!

02:05:20.338 --> 02:05:21.601
By my sword.

02:05:23.516 --> 02:05:25.213
Strength and honor.

02:05:25.387 --> 02:05:27.215
Strength and honor!

02:05:27.389 --> 02:05:28.999
Strength and honor!

02:05:29.173 --> 02:05:31.001
Strength and honor!

02:05:55.722 --> 02:05:57.767
Let it not be said

02:05:57.941 --> 02:06:00.988
that the emperor
is not merciful.

02:06:01.162 --> 02:06:06.602
The queen will be granted
a single gladiator

02:06:06.776 --> 02:06:10.432
to defend her against
the Praetorian Guard.

02:06:20.485 --> 02:06:24.402
The champion, Hanno!

02:06:28.363 --> 02:06:31.845
Hanno! Hanno! Hanno!

02:07:37.475 --> 02:07:39.216
Yes!

02:07:43.438 --> 02:07:45.266
Summon the cavalry.
Put this down at once.

02:07:46.789 --> 02:07:49.183
This is war! Real war!

02:07:54.188 --> 02:07:57.539
The army of Acacius
is advancing
just outside of Rome, sir.

02:08:00.194 --> 02:08:01.586
We can still
outflank them.

02:08:01.761 --> 02:08:04.067
They have only
5,000 troops, no more.

02:08:05.416 --> 02:08:06.853
How many are we?

02:08:07.027 --> 02:08:08.332
Six thousand.
Perhaps more.

02:08:08.506 --> 02:08:10.073
Ride to the gate
and hold them.

02:09:01.908 --> 02:09:02.952
Filthy scum!

02:09:16.836 --> 02:09:18.359
Lucius!

02:09:20.143 --> 02:09:21.188
Give me the bow.

02:09:44.994 --> 02:09:47.431
Go, my son. Lucius--

02:09:47.605 --> 02:09:48.650
Shh-sh-sh-sh...

02:09:48.824 --> 02:09:50.217
Horse!

02:11:23.005 --> 02:11:25.051
Will nothing
kill this barbarian?

02:11:25.225 --> 02:11:27.705
My name is
Lucius Verus Aurelius!

02:11:27.880 --> 02:11:30.143
A man does not become
emperor by bloodline alone.

02:11:30.317 --> 02:11:32.972
It must be taken by force
and kept by force.

02:11:33.146 --> 02:11:34.930
Are you such a man
as this?

02:11:35.104 --> 02:11:36.453
I don't fight for power.

02:11:36.627 --> 02:11:39.282
I fight to free Rome
from men like you

02:11:39.456 --> 02:11:40.893
and to return it to them.

02:11:41.067 --> 02:11:43.808
The gods themselves
want Rome reborn.

02:11:43.983 --> 02:11:46.855
They sent me...
to fulfill that task.

02:11:47.029 --> 02:11:50.467
And what if your gods
sent me here to kill you?

02:11:50.641 --> 02:11:51.686
Huh?

02:11:52.861 --> 02:11:55.037
It's time to end this, Macrinus!

02:12:31.117 --> 02:12:33.336
Hah!

02:13:03.236 --> 02:13:04.715
Strength and honor,

02:13:05.325 --> 02:13:06.848
my son.

02:14:40.202 --> 02:14:41.943
You look to me to speak.

02:14:44.163 --> 02:14:45.773
I know not what
to say other than

02:14:45.947 --> 02:14:47.949
we have all known
too much death.

02:14:49.211 --> 02:14:52.693
Let no more blood be spilt
in the name of tyranny.

02:14:56.653 --> 02:14:59.134
My grandfather,
Marcus Aurelius,

02:14:59.308 --> 02:15:02.094
talked of a dream
that would be Rome.

02:15:03.138 --> 02:15:05.053
A dream that my father,

02:15:06.272 --> 02:15:09.013
Maximus Decimus Meridius,

02:15:09.188 --> 02:15:10.711
died for.

02:15:11.929 --> 02:15:13.540
An ideal.

02:15:16.325 --> 02:15:20.590
A city for the many
and a refuge
for those in need.

02:15:20.764 --> 02:15:23.245
A home worth fighting for.

02:15:24.377 --> 02:15:28.642
A home that Maximus
spent his life defending.

02:15:30.731 --> 02:15:32.559
That dream is lost.

02:15:38.521 --> 02:15:40.132
But dare we...

02:15:41.698 --> 02:15:44.310
rebuild that dream
together?

02:15:56.235 --> 02:15:58.019
What say you?

02:16:04.373 --> 02:16:06.201
Aye!

02:16:07.376 --> 02:16:08.682
Aye!

02:16:09.422 --> 02:16:10.597
Aye!

02:16:10.771 --> 02:16:15.123
Aye! Aye! Aye! Aye!

02:17:19.796 --> 02:17:21.015
Mother.

02:18:13.589 --> 02:18:15.765
Speak to me, Father.
